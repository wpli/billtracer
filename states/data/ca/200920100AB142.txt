						LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 142, Hayashi.
											  California State Lottery.(1) The California State Lottery Act of 1984, enacted by initiative, authorizes a California State Lottery and provides for its operation and administration by the California State Lottery Commission and the Director of the California State Lottery, with certain limitations. The act requires that not less than 84% of the total annual revenues from the sale of state lottery tickets or shares be returned to the public in the form of prizes and net revenues to benefit public education, and that no more than 16% of those revenues be used for expenses of the lottery. The act further specifies that, of that 84%, 50% of the total annual lottery revenues be returned to the public in the form of prizes, and that at least 34% of those revenues be allocated to the benefit of public education. The act establishes the State Lottery Fund, a continuously appropriated fund for carrying out the purposes of the act.This bill would require revenues of the state lottery to be allocated so as to maximize the amount of funding allocated to public education, and would require that not less than 87% of the total annual revenues of the state lottery be returned to the public, and no more than 13% be used for lottery expenses. The bill would further specify that, of that 87%, not less than 50% of the total annual lottery revenues, in an amount to be determined by the commission, be returned to the public in the form of prizes. The bill would require the commission to establish the percentage to be allocated to the benefit of public education at a level that maximizes the total net revenues allocated to the benefit of public education. By changing these allocations, the bill would change the purposes for which the funds of a continuously appropriated fund may be appropriated, and thereby would make an appropriation. The bill would make other conforming changes.This bill would require the lottery, following the end of each full fiscal year, to calculate and report to the Controller and to the Legislature the amount of total net revenues allocated to the benefit of public education from the California State Lottery Education Fund for that fiscal year. The bill would require the Controller, if in any one of the first 5 full fiscal years after the enactment of this measure, the Controller determines that specified events occur, to notify the Legislature and the Governor, and post that notification on the Controller’s Internet Web site. The bill would then provide for the repeal of the changes made by this measure on the following January 1, and the prior law to be restored. If those events do not occur, the bill would require the
		commission, when setting the percentage to be allocated to the benefit of public education, to ensure that net revenues allocated to public schools are at least as much as were allocated on average in the prior 5 fiscal years, and increased in proportion to any upward increases in lottery net revenues. The bill would require the Controller, at the end of the first 5 full fiscal years following enactment of this measure, to convene a lottery review group to report to the Legislature, no later than December 31 following the final fiscal year, on whether the amendments made by this measure have furthered the purposes of the California State Lottery Act of 1984 as intended.(2) The California State Lottery Act of 1984, an initiative measure, specifies that none of its provisions may be changed except to further its purpose by a bill passed by a 2/3 vote of each house of the Legislature and signed by the Governor.This bill would declare that it furthers the purpose of the act and would require a 2/3 vote as an amendment of that act. (3) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.Digest Key

				  community college districts for the purchase of instructional materials, on the basis of an equal amount per unit of average daily attendance, as defined by law, and through a fair and equitable distribution system across grade levels.(3) All unclaimed prize money shall revert to the benefit of public education, as provided for in subdivision (e) of Section 8880.32.(4) All of the interest earned upon funds held in the State Lottery Fund shall be allocated to the benefit of public education, as specified in Section 8880.5.

				  However, this amount shall be allocated for the benefit of public education as specified in Section 8880.5.(e) This section shall remain in effect only until December 31 of the year of notification from the Controller to the Legislature and the Governor that the events described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subdivision (c) of Section 8880.4.5 have occurred, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before December 31 of that year, deletes or extends that date.SEC. 2. Section 8880.4 is added to the Government Code, to read:8880.4. Revenues of the state lottery shall be allocated as follows:(a) Not less than 84 percent of the total annual revenues from the sale of state lottery tickets or shares shall be returned to the public in the form of prizes and net revenues to benefit public education.(1) Fifty percent of the total annual revenues shall be returned to the public in the form of prizes as described in this chapter.(2) At least 34 percent of the total annual revenues shall be allocated to the benefit of public education, as specified in Section 8880.5.

				  in paragraph (2) of subdivision (c), are not a part of the 34 percent of total annual revenues required to be allocated for the benefit of public education, as specified in paragraph (2) of subdivision (a). However, this amount shall be allocated for the benefit of public education as specified in Section 8880.5.(e) This section shall become operative on January 1 of the year following notification from the Controller to the Legislature and the Governor that the events described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subdivision (c) of Section 8880.4.5 have occurred.SEC. 3. Section 8880.4.5 is added to the Government Code, to read:8880.4.5. (a) Following the end of each full fiscal year, the commission shall calculate and report to the Controller and to the Legislature the amount of total net revenues allocated to the benefit of public education from the California State Lottery Education Fund for that fiscal year.(b) To ensure increases in lottery net revenues allocated to public education, if in any one of the first five full fiscal years after the enactment of the act adding this section, the Controller determines that both of the events

In the past 10 years, lottery revenues have grown at a much lower rate than has state spending on education. The experience of other states demonstrates that increasing the share of sales revenues allocated to prizes increases lottery ticket sales sufficient to increase the total net
		  revenues available to the lottery’s beneficiary, which in California is public education. Thus, the purpose of this act is to increase lottery net revenues available to supplement funding for public education, and to maximize the amount of the increase in total net revenues generated by the lottery that are made available to public education.SEC. 9. This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:Because the state is currently in a fiscal crisis, and this act will generate much needed revenue, it is necessary that this act take effect immediately.
