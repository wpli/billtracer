											  Natural resources: climate change.Existing law establishes in state government the Natural Resources Agency consisting of various departments including the Department of Conservation, the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, the Department of Fish and Game, and the Wildlife Conservation Board.This bill would require authorize the Natural Resources Agency to coordinate with other state agencies to review projects, generally and by region, that have been developed to address unavoidable climate change impacts, including those required by a specified executive order and any subsequent climate change adaptation planning required by the state
		develop and amend as necessary a climate change adaptation strategy to assess the state’s vulnerability to impacts of climate change, including the impacts of projected sea-level rise, on the state’s physical and natural infrastructure. The agency would be permitted to develop or augment the strategy by region. The bill would specify what the coordination requirement shall include and how the agency may designate regions.This bill would provide that the strategy is subject to a multidisciplinary review process prior to adoption or approval to ensure that, among other things, ecosystems, sensitive species, or other environmentally sensitive resources or habitats are not inadvertently put at risk or subject to unacceptable, adverse impacts.Digest Key
