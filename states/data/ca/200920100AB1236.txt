											  Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Rehabilitation: United Through Reading Transitions Program.Existing law provides that the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation shall implement in every state prison literacy programs that are designed to ensure that parole inmates are able to achieve a 9th-grade reading level. Existing law also provides that the visitation of inmates has an important role in establishing and maintaining a meaningful connection with the inmate’s family.This bill would provide, in addition, that the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, to the extent existing resources designated to family service or community partnership programs are available or additional resources are appropriated, shall establish a pilot program of unspecified duration in an unspecified number of state prisons that implements the United Through Reading
		Transitions Program, the purpose of which is to foster emotional bonding between inmates and their children and provide the children of inmates with a chance to see their parents in a positive light by enabling the inmates to read books aloud on DVD and send the books and recordings home.Existing law states that any reference in code to the Department of Corrections is a reference to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.This bill would make a technical, nonsubstantive change to that provision.Digest Key
