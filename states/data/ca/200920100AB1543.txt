						LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1543, Jones.
											  Medicare supplement coverage.Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975 (Knox-Keene Act), provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care and makes a willful violation of the act a crime. Existing law provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law requires plans and insurers that issue Medicare supplement contracts or policies, as defined, to comply with specified requirements.The federal Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 requires states to adopt, by September 24, 2009, certain modernization changes to Medicare supplement policies made in a specified model law developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.In addition, the federal Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008, prohibits an issuer of a Medicare supplemental
		policy from denying or conditioning the issuance or effectiveness of the policy, and from discriminating in the pricing of the policy, on the basis of genetic information, as specified. The act further prohibits an issuer of a Medicare supplemental policy from, among other things, requesting or requiring an individual or a family member of that individual to undergo a genetic test, as specified. The act requires states to make changes needed to conform to these requirements by July 1, 2009. This bill would make those conforming changes and would adopt the modernization changes made in the model law developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.Existing law entitles individuals to an annual open enrollment period, commencing with the individual’s birthday, during which time the individual may purchase any Medicare supplement contract or policy that offers benefits equal to or lesser than those provided
		by the previous coverage, as specified.This bill would identify the Medicare supplement plans, based on the modernization changes described above, that provide equal coverage for purposes of this provision.Existing law provides that a person is eligible for the guaranteed issue of a Medicare supplement contract or policy if the person is enrolled under an employee welfare benefit plan that provides health benefits that supplement the benefits under Medicare, and the plan either terminates or ceases to provide all of those supplemental health benefits.This bill would provide that a person is eligible for the guaranteed issue of a Medicare supplement contract or policy if the person is enrolled under an employee welfare benefit plan that provides health benefits that supplement the benefits under Medicare and either the plan terminates or ceases to provide all of those
		supplemental health benefits or the employer no longer provides the individual with insurance that covers all of the payment for the 20% coinsurance.Existing law prohibits an issuer from denying or conditioning the issuance of a Medicare supplement contract or policy because of, among other things, the health status of the applicant during certain open enrollment periods, as specified. Existing law prohibits an issuer from requiring or requesting health information from an applicant who is guaranteed Medicare supplement coverage and from requiring or requesting that applicant to sign a form required by the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Existing law requires the application form to include a statement that the applicant is not required to provide health information or sign a form required by HIPAA during a period of guaranteed issuance.This bill would prohibit an issuer from
		requiring, requesting, or obtaining health information from an applicant who is guaranteed issuance of, or open enrollment for, Medicare supplement coverage, except as specified, and would require the application form to include a statement that the applicant is not required to provide health information during a period where guaranteed issue or open enrollment applies.Existing law provides that an individual enrolled in Medicare Part B is entitled to open enrollment for Medicare supplement coverage upon being notified that he or she is no longer eligible for benefits under the Medi-Cal program.This bill would also make an individual enrolled in Medicare Part B entitled to open enrollment if he or she is only eligible for Medi-Cal benefits with a share of cost and he or she certifies, at the time of application, that he or she has not met the share of cost.Because a willful
		violation of the bill’s requirements with respect to health care service plans would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. This bill would make other conforming, technical, and related changes.The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.Digest Key

A contract shall not be advertised, solicited, or issued for delivery as a Medicare supplement contract unless it complies with these benefit standards.(a) The following general standards apply to Medicare supplement contracts and are in addition to all other requirements of this article:(1) A Medicare supplement contract shall not exclude or limit benefits for losses incurred more than six months from the effective date of coverage because it involved a preexisting condition. The
				  contract shall not define a preexisting condition more restrictively than a condition for which medical advice was given or treatment was recommended by or received from a physician within six months before the effective date of coverage.(2) A Medicare supplement contract shall not indemnify against losses resulting from sickness on a different basis than losses resulting from accidents.(3) A Medicare supplement contract shall provide that benefits designed to cover cost-sharing amounts under Medicare will be changed automatically to coincide with any changes in the applicable Medicare deductible, copayment, or coinsurance amounts. Prepaid or periodic charges may be modified to correspond with those changes.(4) A Medicare supplement contract shall not provide for termination of coverage of a spouse solely because
				  of the occurrence of an event specified for termination of coverage of the covered person, other than the nonpayment of the prepaid or periodic charge.(5) Each Medicare supplement contract shall be guaranteed renewable.(A) The issuer shall not cancel or nonrenew the contract solely on the ground of health status of the individual.(B) The issuer shall not cancel or nonrenew the contract for any reason other than nonpayment of the prepaid or periodic charge or misrepresentation of the risk by the applicant that is shown by the plan to be material to the acceptance for coverage. The contestability period for Medicare supplement contracts shall be two years.(C) If a group Medicare supplement contract is terminated by the subscriber and is not replaced
				  as provided under subparagraph (E), the issuer shall offer enrollees an individual Medicare supplement contract that, at the option of the enrollee, either provides for continuation of the benefits contained in the terminated contract or provides for benefits that otherwise meet the requirements of this subsection.(D) If an individual is an enrollee in a group Medicare supplement contract and the individual membership in the group is terminated, the issuer shall either offer the enrollee the conversion opportunity described in subparagraph (C) or, at the option of the subscriber, shall offer the enrollee continuation of coverage under the group contract.(E) If a group Medicare supplement contract is replaced by another group Medicare supplement contract purchased by the same subscriber, the issuer of the replacement contract shall offer coverage to all persons covered under the
				  old group contract on its date of termination. Coverage under the new contract shall not result in any exclusion for preexisting conditions that would have been covered under the group contract being replaced.(F) If a Medicare supplement contract eliminates an outpatient prescription drug benefit as a result of requirements imposed by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-173), the contract as modified as a result of that act shall be deemed to satisfy the guaranteed renewal requirements of this paragraph.(6) Termination of a Medicare supplement contract shall be without prejudice to any continuous loss that commenced while the contract was in force, but the extension of benefits beyond the period during which the contract was in force may be predicated upon the continuous total disability of the covered person, limited to the
				  duration of the contract benefit period, if any, or to payment of the maximum benefits. Receipt of Medicare Part D benefits shall not be considered in determining a continuous loss.(7) (A) (i) A Medicare supplement contract shall provide that benefits and prepaid or periodic charges under the contract shall be suspended at the request of the enrollee for the period, not to exceed 24 months, in which the enrollee has applied for and is determined to be entitled to medical assistance under Title XIX of the federal Social Security Act, but only if the enrollee notifies the issuer of the contract within 90 days after the date the individual becomes entitled to assistance.If suspension occurs and if the enrollee loses entitlement to medical assistance, the contract shall be automatically reinstituted (effective as of the date of termination of entitlement) as of
				  the termination of entitlement if the enrollee provides notice of loss of entitlement within 90 days after the date of loss and pays the prepaid or periodic charge attributable to the period, effective as of the date of termination of entitlement. Upon receipt of timely notice, the issuer shall return directly to the enrollee that portion of the prepaid or periodic charge attributable to the period the enrollee was entitled to medical assistance, subject to adjustment for paid claims.(ii) A Medicare supplement contract shall provide that benefits and premiums under the contract shall be suspended at the request of the enrollee or subscriber for any period that may be provided by federal regulation if the enrollee or subscriber is entitled to benefits under Section 226(b) of the Social Security Act and is covered under a group health plan, as defined in Section 1862(b)(1)(A)(v) of the Social Security Act. If suspension occurs and the enrollee
				  or subscriber loses coverage under the group health plan, the contract shall be automatically reinstituted, effective as of the date of loss of coverage if the enrollee or subscriber provides notice within 90 days of the date of the loss of coverage.(B) Reinstitution of coverages:(i) Shall not provide for any waiting period with respect to treatment of preexisting conditions.(ii) Shall provide for resumption of coverage that is substantially equivalent to coverage in effect before the date of suspension. If the suspended Medicare supplement contract provided coverage for outpatient prescription drugs, reinstitution of the contract for a Medicare Part D enrollee shall not include coverage for outpatient prescription drugs but shall otherwise provide coverage that is substantially equivalent to the coverage in
				  effect before the date of suspension.(iii) Shall provide for classification of prepaid or periodic charges on terms at least as favorable to the enrollee as the prepaid or periodic charge classification terms that would have applied to the enrollee had the coverage not been suspended.(8) If an issuer makes a written offer to the Medicare supplement enrollee or subscriber of one or more of its plan contracts, to exchange during a specified period from his or her 1990 standardized plan, as described in Section 1358.9, to a 2010 standardized plan, as described in Section 1358.91, the offer and subsequent exchange shall comply with the following requirements:(A) An issuer need not provide justification to the director if the enrollee or subscriber replaces a 1990 standardized plan contract with an issue age rated 2010
				  standardized plan contract at the enrollee or subscriber’s original issue age and duration. If an enrollee or subscriber’s plan contract to be replaced is priced on an issue age rate schedule at the time of that offer, the rate charged to the enrollee or subscriber for the new exchanged plan shall recognize the plan contract reserve buildup, due to the prefunding inherent in the use of an issue age rate basis, for the benefit of the enrollee or subscriber. The method proposed to be used by an issuer shall be filed with the director.(B) The rating class of the new plan contract shall be the class closest to the enrollee or subscriber’s class of the replaced coverage.(C) An issuer may not apply new preexisting condition limitations or a new incontestability period to the new plan contract for those benefits contained in the exchanged 1990 standardized plan contract of the enrollee
				  or subscriber, but may apply preexisting condition limitations of no more than six months to any added benefits contained in the new 2010 standardized plan contract not contained in the exchanged plan contract. This subparagraph shall not apply to an applicant who is guaranteed issue under Section 1358.11 or 1358.12.(D) The new plan contract shall be offered to all enrollees or subscribers within a given plan, except where the offer or issue would be in violation of state or federal law.(9) A Medicare supplement contract shall not be limited to coverage for a single disease or affliction.(10) A Medicare supplement contract shall provide an examination period of 30 days after the receipt of the contract by the applicant for purposes of review, during which time the applicant may return the contract as described in subdivision (e) of
				  Section 1358.17.(11) A Medicare supplement contract shall additionally meet any other minimum benefit standards as established by the director.(12) Within 30 days prior to the effective date of any Medicare benefit changes, an issuer shall file with the director, and notify its subscribers and enrollees of, modifications it has made to Medicare supplement contracts.(A) The notice shall include a description of revisions to the Medicare Program and a description of each modification made to the coverage provided under the Medicare supplement contract.(B) The notice shall inform each subscriber and enrollee as to when any adjustment in the prepaid or periodic charges will be made due to changes in Medicare benefits.(C) The notice of benefit modifications and any adjustments to the prepaid or periodic charges shall be in outline form and in clear and simple terms so as to facilitate comprehension. The notice shall not contain or be accompanied by any solicitation.(13) No modifications to existing Medicare supplement coverage shall be made at the time of, or in connection with, the notice requirements of this article except to the extent necessary to eliminate duplication of Medicare benefits and any modifications necessary under the contract to provide indexed benefit adjustment.(b) With respect to the standards for basic (core) benefits for benefit plans A to J, inclusive, every issuer shall make available a contract including only the following basic “core” package of benefits to each prospective applicant. This “core” package
				  of benefits shall be referred to as standardized Medicare supplement benefit plan “A”. An issuer may make available to prospective applicants any of the other Medicare supplement benefit plans in addition to the basic core package, but not in lieu of that package.(1) Coverage of Part A Medicare eligible expenses for hospitalization to the extent not covered by Medicare from the 61st day to the 90th day, inclusive, in any Medicare benefit period.(2) Coverage of Part A Medicare eligible expenses incurred for hospitalization to the extent not covered by Medicare for each Medicare lifetime inpatient reserve day used.(3) Upon exhaustion of the Medicare hospital inpatient coverage including the lifetime reserve days, coverage of 100 percent of the Medicare Part A eligible expenses for hospitalization paid at the

No contract may be advertised, solicited, delivered, or issued for delivery in this state as a Medicare supplement contract unless it complies with these benefit standards. No issuer may offer any 1990 standardized Medicare supplement contract for sale with an effective date on or after June 1, 2010. Benefit standards applicable to Medicare supplement contracts issued with an effective date before June 1, 2010, remain subject to the requirements of Section 1358.8.(a) The following general standards apply to Medicare supplement contracts and are in addition to all other requirements of this
				  article.(1) A Medicare supplement contract shall not exclude or limit benefits for losses incurred more than six months from the effective date of coverage because it involved a preexisting condition. The contract shall not define a preexisting condition more restrictively than a condition for which medical advice was given or treatment was recommended by, or received from, a physician within six months before the effective date of coverage.(2) A Medicare supplement contract shall not indemnify against losses resulting from sickness on a different basis than losses resulting from accidents.(3) A Medicare supplement contract shall provide that benefits designed to cover cost-sharing amounts under Medicare will be changed automatically to coincide with any changes in the applicable Medicare deductible, copayment, or
				  coinsurance amounts. Prepaid or periodic charges may be modified to correspond with those changes.(4) A Medicare supplement contract shall not provide for termination of coverage of a spouse solely because of the occurrence of an event specified for termination of coverage of the enrollee or subscriber, other than the nonpayment of prepaid or periodic charges.(5) Each Medicare supplement contract shall be guaranteed renewable.(A) The issuer shall not cancel or nonrenew the contract solely on the ground of health status of the individual.(B) The issuer shall not cancel or nonrenew the contract for any reason other than nonpayment of prepaid or periodic charges or misrepresentation of the risk by the applicant that is shown by the plan to be material
				  to the acceptance for coverage. The contestability period for Medicare supplement contracts shall be two years.(C) If the Medicare supplement contract is terminated by the group contractholder and is not replaced as provided under subparagraph (E), the issuer shall offer enrollees or subscribers an individual Medicare supplement contract which, at the option of the enrollee or subscriber, does one of the following:(i) Provides for continuation of the benefits contained in the group contract.(ii) Provides for benefits that otherwise meet the requirements of one of the standardized contracts defined in this article.(D) If an individual is an enrollee or subscriber in a group Medicare supplement contract and the individual terminates membership in the

Coverage under the new contract shall not result in any exclusion for preexisting conditions that would have been covered under the group contract being replaced.(ii) If a
				  Medicare supplement contract replaces another Medicare supplement contract that has been in force for six months or more, the replacing issuer shall not impose an exclusion or limitation based on a preexisting condition. If the original coverage has been in force for less than six months, the replacing issuer shall waive any time period applicable to preexisting conditions, waiting periods, elimination periods, or probationary periods in the new contract to the extent the time was spent under the original coverage.(6) Termination of a Medicare supplement contract shall be without prejudice to any continuous loss that commenced while the contract was in force, but the extension of benefits beyond the period during which the contract was in force may be predicated upon the continuous total disability of the enrollee or subscriber, limited to the duration of the contract benefit period, if any, or payment of the maximum benefits. Receipt of
				  Medicare Part D benefits shall not be considered in determining a continuous loss.(7) (A) (i) A Medicare supplement contract shall provide that benefits and prepaid or periodic charges under the contract shall be suspended at the request of the enrollee or subscriber for the period, not to exceed 24 months, in which the enrollee or subscriber has applied for, and is determined to be entitled to, medical assistance under Medi-Cal under Title XIX of the federal Social Security Act, but only if the enrollee or subscriber notifies the issuer of the contract within 90 days after the date the individual becomes entitled to assistance. Upon receipt of timely notice, the insurer shall return directly to the enrollee or subscriber that portion of the prepaid or periodic charge attributable to the period of Medi-Cal eligibility, subject to adjustment for paid claims.(ii) If suspension occurs and if the enrollee or subscriber loses entitlement to medical assistance under Medi-Cal, the Medicare supplement contract shall be automatically reinstituted (effective as of the date of termination of entitlement) as of the termination of entitlement if the enrollee or subscriber provides notice of loss of entitlement within 90 days after the date of loss and pays the prepaid or periodic charge attributable to the period, effective as of the date of termination of entitlement or equivalent coverage shall be provided if the prior contract is no longer available.(iii) Each Medicare supplement contract shall provide that benefits and prepaid or periodic charges under the contract shall be suspended (for any period that may be provided by federal regulation) at the request of the enrollee or subscriber if the enrollee or subscriber is entitled to benefits under
				  Section 226(b) of the Social Security Act and is covered under a group health plan (as defined in Section 1862(b)(1)(A)(v) of the Social Security Act). If suspension occurs and if the enrollee or subscriber loses coverage under the group health plan, the contract shall be automatically reinstituted (effective as of the date of loss of coverage) if the enrollee or subscriber provides notice of loss of coverage within 90 days after the date of the loss and pays the applicable prepaid or periodic charge.(B) Reinstitution of coverages shall comply with all of the following requirements:(i) Not provide for any waiting period with respect to treatment of preexisting conditions.(ii) Provide for resumption of coverage that is substantially equivalent to coverage in effect before the date of suspension.(iii) Provide for classification of prepaid or periodic charges on terms at least as favorable to the enrollee or subscriber as the classification of the prepaid or periodic charge that would have applied to the enrollee or subscriber had the coverage not been suspended.(8) A Medicare supplement contract shall not be limited to coverage for a single disease or affliction.(9) A Medicare supplement contract shall provide an examination period of 30 days after the receipt of the contract by the applicant for purposes of review, during which time the applicant may return the contract as described in subdivision (e) of Section 1358.17.(10) A Medicare supplement contract shall additionally meet any other minimum benefit standards as established by the director.(11) Within 30 days prior to the
				  effective date of any Medicare benefit changes, an issuer shall file with the director, and notify its subscribers and enrollees of, modifications it has made to Medicare supplement contracts.(A) The notice shall include a description of revisions to the Medicare Program and a description of each modification made to the coverage provided under the Medicare supplement contract.(B) The notice shall inform each subscriber and enrollee as to when any adjustment in the prepaid or periodic charges will be made due to changes in Medicare benefits.(C) The notice of benefit modifications and any adjustments to the prepaid or periodic charges shall be in outline form and in clear and simple terms so as to facilitate comprehension. The notice shall not contain or be accompanied by any solicitation.(12) No modifications to existing Medicare supplement coverage shall be made at the time of, or in

IT MAY BE IMPORTANT TO YOU IN THE FUTUREAccording to [your application] [information you have furnished], you intend to lapse or otherwise terminate an existing Medicare supplement policy or contract or Medicare Advantage plan and replace it with a contract to be issued by [Plan Name]. Your contract to be issued by [Plan Name] will provide 30 days within which you may decide without cost whether you desire to keep the contract. You should review this new coverage carefully. Compare it with all accident and sickness coverage you now have. Terminate your present policy or contract only if, after due consideration, you find that purchase of this Medicare supplement coverage is a wise decision. STATEMENT TO APPLICANT BY PLAN, SOLICITOR, SOLICITOR FIRM, OR
				  OTHER REPRESENTATIVE:(1) I have reviewed your current medical or health coverage. To the best of my knowledge, the replacement of coverage involved in this transaction does not duplicate coverage or, if applicable, Medicare Advantage coverage because you intend to terminate your existing Medicare supplement coverage or leave your Medicare Advantage plan. The replacement contract is being purchased for the following reason (check one):__ Additional benefits. __ No change in benefits, but lower premiums or charges. __ Fewer benefits and lower premiums or charges.__ Plan has outpatient prescription drug coverage and applicant is enrolled in Medicare Part D.__ Disenrollment from a Medicare Advantage plan. Reasons for disenrollment:__ Other. (please specify) ________.(2) If the issuer of the Medicare supplement contract being applied for does not impose, or is otherwise prohibited from imposing, preexisting condition limitations, please skip to statement 3 below. Health conditions that you may presently have (preexisting conditions) may not be immediately or fully covered under the new contract. This could result in denial or delay of a claim for benefits under the new contract, whereas a similar claim might have been payable under your present contract.(3) State law provides that your replacement Medicare supplement contract may not contain new preexisting conditions, waiting periods, elimination periods, or probationary periods. The plan will waive any time periods applicable to preexisting conditions, waiting periods, elimination periods, or probationary periods in the new coverage for similar benefits to the extent that time was spent
				  (depleted) under the original contract.(4) If you still wish to terminate your present policy or contract and replace it with new coverage, be certain to truthfully and completely answer any and all questions on the application concerning your medical and health history. Failure to include all material medical information on an application requesting that information may provide a basis for the plan to deny any future claims and to refund your prepaid or periodic payment as though your contract had never been in force. After the application has been completed and before you sign it, review it carefully to be certain that all information has been properly recorded.(5) Do not cancel your present Medicare supplement coverage until you have received your new contract and are sure you want to keep it.(Signature of Solicitor, Solicitor Firm, or Other Representative)[Typed Name and Address of Plan, Solicitor, or Solicitor Firm](Applicant’s Signature)(Date)(f) The application form or other consumer information for persons eligible for Medicare and used by an issuer shall contain as an attachment a Medicare supplement buyer’s guide in the form approved by the director.

No issuer shall make use of or otherwise disseminate any buyer’s guide that does not accurately outline current Medicare supplement benefits. No issuer shall be required to provide more than one copy of the buyer’s guide to any applicant.(g) An issuer may comply with the requirement of this section in the case of group contracts by causing the subscriber (1) to disseminate copies of the disclosure form containing as an attachment the buyer’s guide to all persons eligible under the group contract at the time those persons are offered the Medicare supplement plan, and (2) collecting and forwarding to the issuer an acknowledgment of receipt of the disclosure form containing as an attachment the buyer’s guide from each enrollee.(h) An issuer shall not require, request, or obtain health information as part of the application process for an applicant who is eligible for guaranteed issuance of, or open enrollment for, any Medicare supplement coverage pursuant to Section 1358.11 or 1358.12, except for purposes of paragraph (1) or (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 1358.11 when the applicant is first enrolled in Medicare Part

A policy or certificate shall not be advertised, solicited, or issued for delivery as a Medicare supplement policy or certificate unless it complies with these benefit standards.(a) The following general standards apply to Medicare supplement policies and certificates and are in addition to all other requirements of this article:(1) A Medicare supplement policy or certificate shall not exclude or limit benefits for losses incurred more than six months from the
				  effective date of coverage because it involved a preexisting condition. The policy or certificate shall not define a preexisting condition more restrictively than a condition for which medical advice was given or treatment was recommended by or received from a physician within six months before the effective date of coverage.(2) A Medicare supplement policy or certificate shall not indemnify against losses resulting from sickness on a different basis than losses resulting from accidents.(3) A Medicare supplement policy or certificate shall provide that benefits designed to cover cost-sharing amounts under Medicare will be changed automatically to coincide with any changes in the applicable Medicare deductible, copayment, or coinsurance amounts. Premiums may be modified to correspond with those changes.(4) A
				  Medicare supplement policy or certificate shall not provide for termination of coverage of a spouse solely because of the occurrence of an event specified for termination of coverage of the insured, other than the nonpayment of premium.(5) Each Medicare supplement policy shall be guaranteed renewable or noncancelable.(A) The issuer shall not cancel or nonrenew the policy solely on the ground of health status of the individual.(B) The issuer shall not cancel or nonrenew the policy for any reason other than nonpayment of premium or misrepresentation which is shown by the issuer to be material to the acceptance for coverage. The contestability period for Medicare supplement insurance shall be two years.(C) If the Medicare supplement policy is
				  terminated by the master policyholder and is not replaced as provided under subparagraph (E), the issuer shall offer certificate holders an individual Medicare supplement policy that, at the option of the certificate holder, either provides for continuation of the benefits contained in the group policy or provides for benefits that otherwise meet the requirements of one of the standardized policies defined in this article.(D) If an individual is a certificate holder in a group Medicare supplement policy and membership in the group is terminated, the issuer shall either offer the certificate holder the conversion opportunity described in subparagraph (C) or, at the option of the group policyholder, shall offer the certificate holder continuation of coverage under the group policy.(E) (i) If a group Medicare supplement policy is replaced by another group
				  Medicare supplement policy purchased by the same policyholder, the issuer of the replacement policy shall offer coverage to all persons covered under the old group policy on its date of termination. Coverage under the new policy shall not result in any exclusion for preexisting conditions that would have been covered under the group policy being replaced.(ii) If a Medicare supplement policy or certificate replaces another Medicare supplement policy or certificate that has been in force for six months or more, the replacing issuer shall not impose an exclusion or limitation based on a preexisting condition. If the original coverage has been in force for less than six months, the replacing issuer shall waive any time period applicable to preexisting conditions, waiting periods, elimination periods, or probationary periods in the new policy or certificate to the extent the time was spent under the original coverage.(F) If a Medicare supplement policy eliminates an outpatient prescription drug benefit as a result of requirements imposed by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-173), the policy as modified as a result of that act shall be deemed to satisfy the guaranteed renewal requirements of this paragraph.(6) Termination of a Medicare supplement policy or certificate shall be without prejudice to any continuous loss that commenced while the policy was in force, but the extension of benefits beyond the period during which the policy was in force may be predicated upon the continuous total disability of the insured, limited to the duration of the policy benefit period, if any, or to payment of the maximum benefits. Receipt of Medicare Part D benefits shall not be considered in determining a continuous loss.(7) (A) (i) A Medicare supplement policy or certificate shall provide that benefits and premiums under the policy or certificate shall be suspended at the request of the policyholder or certificate holder for the period, not to exceed 24 months, in which the policyholder or certificate holder has applied for and is determined to be entitled to Medi-Cal, but only if the policyholder or certificate holder notifies the issuer of the policy or certificate within 90 days after the date the individual becomes entitled to assistance. Upon receipt of timely notice, the insurer shall return directly to the insured that portion of the premium attributable to the period of Medi-Cal eligibility, subject to adjustment for paid claims. If suspension occurs and if the policyholder or certificate holder loses entitlement to Medi-Cal, the policy or certificate shall be automatically reinstituted (effective as of the date
				  of termination of entitlement) as of the termination of entitlement if the policyholder or certificate holder provides notice of loss of entitlement within 90 days after the date of loss and pays the premium attributable to the period, effective as of the date of termination of entitlement, or equivalent coverage shall be provided if the prior form is no longer available.(ii) A Medicare supplement policy or certificate shall provide that benefits and premiums under the policy or certificate shall be suspended at the request of the policyholder or certificate holder for any period that may be provided by federal regulation if the policyholder is entitled to benefits under Section 226(b) of the Social Security Act and is covered under a group health plan, as defined in Section 1862(b)(1)(A)(v) of the Social Security Act. If suspension occurs and the policyholder or certificate holder loses coverage under the group health plan, the policy or
				  certificate shall be automatically reinstituted, effective as of the date of loss of coverage if the policyholder provides notice within 90 days of the date of the loss of coverage.(B) Reinstitution of coverages:(i) Shall not provide for any waiting period with respect to treatment of preexisting conditions.(ii) Shall provide for resumption of coverage that is substantially equivalent to coverage in effect before the date of suspension. If the suspended Medicare supplement policy provided coverage for outpatient prescription drugs, reinstitution of the policy for a Medicare Part D enrollee shall not include coverage for outpatient prescription drugs but shall otherwise provide coverage that is substantially equivalent to the coverage in effect before the date of suspension.(iii) Shall provide for classification of premiums on terms at least as favorable to the policyholder or certificate holder as the premium classification terms that would have applied to the policyholder or certificate holder had the coverage not been suspended.(8) If an issuer makes a written offer to the Medicare supplement policyholders or certificate holders of one or more of its plans, to exchange during a specified period from his or her 1990 standardized plan, as described in Section 10192.9, to a 2010 standardized plan, as described in Section 10192.91, the offer and subsequent exchange shall comply with the following requirements:(A) An issuer need not provide justification to the commissioner if the insured replaces a 1990 standardized policy or certificate with an issue age rated 2010 standardized policy or
				  certificate at the insured’s original issue age and duration. If an insured’s policy or certificate to be replaced is priced on an issue age rate schedule at the time of that offer, the rate charged to the insured for the new exchanged policy shall recognize the policy reserve buildup, due to the prefunding inherent in the use of an issue age rate basis, for the benefit of the insured. The method proposed to be used by an issuer shall be filed with the commissioner.(B) The rating class of the new policy or certificate shall be the class closest to the insured’s class of the replaced coverage.(C) An issuer shall not apply new preexisting condition limitations or a new incontestability period to the new policy for those benefits contained in the exchanged 1990 standardized policy or certificate of the insured, but may apply preexisting condition limitations of no more than six
				  months to any added benefits contained in the new 2010 standardized policy or certificate not contained in the exchanged policy. This subparagraph shall not apply to an applicant who is guaranteed issue under Section 10192.11 or 10192.12.(D) The new policy or certificate shall be offered to all policyholders or certificate holders within a given plan, except where the offer or issue would be in violation of state or federal law.(9) A Medicare supplement policy shall not limit coverage exclusively to a single disease or affliction.(b) With respect to the standards for basic (core) benefits for benefit plans A to J, inclusive, every issuer shall make available a policy or certificate including only the following basic “core” package of benefits to each prospective insured.

A supplementary application or other form to be signed by the applicant and agent containing those questions and statements may be used.(Statements)(1) You do not need more than one Medicare supplement policy.(2) If you purchase this policy, you may want to evaluate your existing health coverage and decide if you need multiple coverages.(3) You may be eligible for benefits under Medi-Cal and may not need a Medicare supplement policy.(4)  If after purchasing this policy you become eligible for Medi-Cal, the benefits and premiums under your Medicare supplement policy can be suspended, if requested, during your entitlement to benefits under Medi-Cal for 24 months.

				  employer or union-based group health plan.

				  SUPPLEMENT COVERAGE OR MEDICARE ADVANTAGESAVE THIS NOTICE! IT MAY BE IMPORTANT IN THE FUTURE.If you intend to cancel or terminate existing Medicare supplement or Medicare Advantage insurance and replace it with coverage issued by [company name], please review the new coverage carefully and replace the existing coverage ONLY if the new coverage materially improves your position. DO NOT CANCEL YOUR PRESENT COVERAGE UNTIL YOU HAVE RECEIVED YOUR NEW POLICY AND ARE SURE THAT YOU WANT TO KEEP IT.If you decide to purchase the new coverage, you will have 30 days after you receive the policy to return it to the insurer, for any reason, and receive a refund of your money.If you want to discuss buying Medicare supplement or Medicare Advantage coverage with a trained insurance counselor, call the California Department of Insurance’s toll-free
				  telephone number 1-800-927-HELP, and ask how to contact your local Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy Program (HICAP) office. HICAP is a service provided free of charge by the State of California.STATEMENT TO APPLICANT FROM THE INSURER AND AGENT: I have reviewed your current health insurance coverage. To the best of my knowledge, the replacement of insurance involved in this transaction does not duplicate coverage or, if applicable, Medicare Advantage coverage because you intend to terminate your existing Medicare supplement coverage or leave your Medicare Advantage plan. In addition, the replacement coverage contains benefits that are clearly and substantially greater than your current benefits for the following reasons:__ Additional benefits that are: ________ No change in benefits, but lower premiums.__ Fewer benefits and
				  lower premiums.__ Plan has outpatient prescription drug coverage and applicant is enrolled in Medicare Part D.__ Disenrollment from a Medicare Advantage plan. Reasons for disenrollment:__ Other reasons specified here: ______1. Note: If the issuer of the Medicare supplement policy being applied for does not impose, or is otherwise prohibited from imposing, preexisting condition limitations, please skip to statement 3 below. Health conditions that you may presently have (preexisting conditions) may not be immediately or fully covered under the new policy. This could result in denial or delay of a claim for benefits under the new policy, whereas a similar claim might have been payable under your present policy.2. State law provides that your replacement Medicare supplement policy may not contain
				  new preexisting conditions, waiting periods, elimination periods, or probationary periods. The insurer will waive any time periods applicable to preexisting conditions, waiting periods, elimination periods, or probationary periods in the new coverage for similar benefits to the extent that time was spent (depleted) under the original policy.3. If you still wish to terminate your present policy and replace it with new coverage, be certain to truthfully and completely answer any and all questions on the application concerning your medical and health history. Failure to include all material medical information on an application requesting that information may provide a basis for the insurer to deny any future claims and to refund your premium as though your policy had never been in force. After the application has been completed and before you sign it, review it carefully to be certain that all information has been properly recorded. [If the policy or certificate is
				  guaranteed issue, this paragraph need not appear.]DO NOT CANCEL YOUR PRESENT POLICY UNTIL YOU HAVE RECEIVED YOUR NEW POLICY AND ARE SURE THAT YOU WANT TO KEEP IT.(Signature of Agent, Broker, or Other Representative)(Signature of

				  enrollment for, any Medicare supplement coverage pursuant to Section 10192.11 or 10192.12, except for purposes of paragraph (1) or (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 10192.11 when the applicant is first enrolled in Medicare Part B. The application form shall include a clear and conspicuous statement that the applicant is not required to provide health information during a period where guaranteed issue or open enrollment applies, as specified in Section 10192.11 or 10192.12, except for purposes of paragraph (1) or (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 10192.11 when the applicant is first enrolled in Medicare Part B, and shall inform the applicant of those periods of guaranteed issuance of Medicare supplement coverage. This subdivision shall not prohibit an issuer from requiring proof of eligibility for a guaranteed issuance of Medicare supplement coverage.
