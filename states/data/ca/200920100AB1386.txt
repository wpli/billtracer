						LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1386, Hayashi.
											  State highways.Existing law authorizes a city or county in which a planned transportation facility was to be located on State Highway Route 238 in Alameda County to develop and file with the California Transportation Commission a local alternative transportation improvement program that addresses transportation problems and opportunities, and provides for the use of revenues from the sales of excess properties acquired for the planned state facility in order to fund the local alternative transportation improvement program, but limits the use of revenues from excess property sales to state highway purposes. Existing law provides that the commission may not approve a local alternative transportation improvement program under these provisions after July 1, 2010. Similar provisions apply to State Highway Route 84 in the Cities of Fremont and Union City, except that the use of revenues from excess property sales in that corridor are limited to state highway purposes or projects in
		the local voter-approved transportation sales tax measure.This bill would modify the restriction limiting use of revenues from excess property sales to state highway purposes applicable to State Highway Route 238 by authorizing those revenues to be used for any highway purpose. This bill would require revenues from excess property sales for State Highway Route 238 and State Highway Route 84 to be deposited into separate accounts in the Special Deposit Fund, a continuously appropriated fund, to be available for expenditure by local agencies for purposes of an approved local alternative transportation improvement program for the applicable corridor route. The bill would thereby make an appropriation.This bill would also authorize local agencies to advance projects in the local alternative transportation improvement program with local funds, to be repaid when revenues from excess property sales become available, as
		specified. This bill would require the California Transportation Commission to adopt guidelines in that regard.Existing law requires a local alternative transportation improvement program for State Highway Route 238 to provide, among other things, relocation assistance and replacement housing units for persons displaced as a result of the sale of excess properties to fund the local alternative transportation improvement program.This bill would make these provisions inoperative, and would enact new provisions to become operative, on the date on which the superior court issues the final approval order for the settlement agreement related to the disposition of excess properties acquired for the State Route 238 Hayward Bypass Project signed by the department, the City of Hayward, and representatives for members of the class of residents, or on
		January 1, 2010, whichever comes later. The new provisions would, among other things, require monetary assistance to eligible tenant households and provision of 237 additional new low-income housing units. The new provisions would also require the department to offer the direct sale of eligible excess single-family residences on an as-is, fair market value basis, to current tenants meeting specified requirements and would enact other related provisions in that regard. The bill would authorize proceeds from the sale of excess properties to be used for the cost of selling the properties and various administrative, commercial, or legal costs, including program administration costs to develop and administer the home purchase program and an administrative hearing process for tenants.Existing law provides for state highways to be constructed, as determined by the California Transportation Commission, on routes authorized by law. Existing law
		provides for relinquishment by the commission of state highways to local agencies under certain conditions.This bill would authorize the commission to relinquish portions of State Highway Routes 92, 185, and 238 in the City of Hayward to that city subject to various conditions.Digest Key

				  households shall have occupied their residence on the date that the local alternative transportation improvement program was approved by the commission.

The excess property may be used for housing purposes after sale by the department.(c) Notwithstanding subdivision (b), proceeds from the sale of the excess properties may be used for the cost of selling the properties, including all of the following:(1) All necessary surveys of tenants occupying excess properties.(2) Appraisal costs, including review appraisals.(3) Program administration
				  costs to develop and administer the home purchase program.(4) Program administration costs to develop and provide an administrative hearing process for excess property tenants related to any housing programs or program assistance offered to those excess property tenants.(5) Other administrative, commercial, or legal costs necessary for selling the excess properties.(d) Any person or persons commencing initial occupancy of or entering into a new rental or lease agreement for a property located on the State Route 238 Hayward Bypass Project on or after January 1, 2010, and before the sale of the properties by the department or its authorized agent, shall not be eligible for any additional relocation assistance under any provision of state law, including Section 50460 of the Health and Safety Code, and shall be notified prior to occupying the property that such occupancy, rental, or lease is temporary regardless of length of
				  occupancy.(e) For purposes of this section, “eligible tenant household” shall mean a household comprised of a tenant or group of tenants in good standing, pursuant to a valid, written rental agreement with the department as of the date on which the superior court preliminarily approves the settlement agreement described in subdivision (a), and who are members of the class covered by that settlement.(f) This section shall become operative on the date on which the superior court issues the final approval order for the settlement agreement related to the disposition of excess properties acquired for the State Route 238 Hayward Bypass Project signed by the department, the City of Hayward, and representatives for members of the class of residents, or on January 1, 2010, whichever comes later.SEC. 6. Section 14528.65 is added to the Government Code, to read:14528.65. (a) All of the following shall apply to the sale or other disposition of excess property to fund the local alternative transportation improvement program approved pursuant to Section 14528.5:(1) At the time the commission rescinds the freeway adoption previously approved for the State Route 238 Hayward Bypass Project, and the commission approves the local alternative transportation improvement program, the commission shall authorize the department to sell, on an “as is” basis at fair market value, the excess properties acquired for the State Route 238 Hayward Bypass Project.

The commission is hereby authorized and directed to approve any such sale transaction provided the commission determines the sale to be “as is” at fair market value.(6) The department may hire, or cause to be hired, an appraiser to determine the “as is” fair market value of any single-family residence for which a direct sale to a residential tenant is contemplated as provided for in paragraph (4) or (5).
