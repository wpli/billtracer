						Wiggins)February 27, 2009An act to amend Section 51101.1 of the Education Code, relating to public schools.LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1510, Eng.
											  Public schools: parental access.Existing law provides that the parents and guardians of pupils enrolled in public schools have the right and should have the opportunity, as mutually supportive and respectful partners in the education of their children within the public schools, to be informed by the school, and to participate in the education of their children, as specified, except to the extent that informing a parent or guardian or permitting participation by a parent or guardian in the education of a child conflicts with a valid restraining order, protective order, or order for custody or visitation issued by a court of competent jurisdiction. Existing law requires a school district to take all reasonable steps to ensure that all parents and guardians of pupils who speak a language other than English are properly notified in English and in their home language of these rights and opportunities. This bill would authorize parents and guardians of
		English learners to bring an oral language interpreter to all conferences, meetings, or proceedings held at a school district building or schoolsite or sponsored by the school district or school, except when prohibited by state or federal law.Digest Key

                                NO  Bill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. Section 51101.1 of the Education Code is amended to read:51101.1. (a) A parent or guardian’s lack of English fluency does not preclude a parent or guardian from exercising the rights guaranteed under this chapter. A school district shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that all parents and guardians of pupils who speak a language other than English are properly notified in English and in their home language, pursuant to Section 48985, of the rights and opportunities available to them pursuant to this section.(b) Parents and guardians of English learners are entitled to participate in the education of their children pursuant to Section 51101 and as follows:(1) To receive, pursuant to paragraph (5) of subdivision (a) of
				  Section 51101, the results of their child’s performance on standardized tests, including the English language development test.(2) To be given any required written notification, under any applicable law, in English and the pupil’s home language pursuant to Section 48985.(3) To participate in school and district advisory bodies in accordance with federal and state laws and regulations.(4) To support their children’s advancement toward literacy. School personnel shall encourage parents and guardians of English learners to support their child’s progress toward literacy both in English and, to the extent possible, in the child’s home language. School districts are encouraged to make available, to the extent possible, surplus or undistributed instructional materials to parents and guardians, pursuant to subdivision (d)
				  of Section 60510, in order to facilitate parental involvement in their children’s education.(5) To be informed, pursuant to Sections 33126 and 48985, about statewide and local academic standards, testing programs, accountability measures, and school improvement efforts.(6) To bring an oral language interpreter to conferences, meetings, or proceedings held at a school district building or schoolsite or sponsored by the school district or school, except when doing so would conflict with state or federal law. This paragraph does not require a school district to bear the cost of an oral language interpreter who is brought by a parent. This paragraph shall not be construed to
				  reduce or eliminate any existing duties of a school district under state or federal law to provide a language interpreter.(c) A school with a substantial number of pupils with a home language other than English is encouraged to establish parent centers with personnel who can communicate with the parents and guardians of these children to encourage understanding of and participation in the educational programs in which their children are enrolled.
