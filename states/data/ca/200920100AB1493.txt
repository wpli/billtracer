											  Alcoholic beverages: advertising.Existing law generally prohibits a manufacturer of alcoholic beverages and a winegrower from paying, crediting, or compensating a retailer for advertising or paying or giving anything of value for the privilege of placing a sign or advertisement with a retail licensee. It authorizes, as an exception, the holder of a winegrower’s license, a beer manufacturer, a distilled spirits manufacturer, or a distilled spirits manufacturer’s agent, to purchase advertising space and time from, or on behalf of, an on–sale retail licensee, under certain conditions, if the on–sale retail licensee is the owner, manager, agent of the owner, assignee of the owner’s advertising rights, or major tenant of specified facilities, including specified facilities located in the County of Los Angeles.This bill would instead limit this exception to specified facilities located in the City of Los Angeles.This bill would make findings regarding the need for special legislation.
