											  Health care coverage: utilization review.Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care. Existing law also provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law requires health care service plans and health insurers to disclose to specified persons the process the plan or insurer uses to authorize, modify, or deny health care services and requires the criteria plans or insurers use to make that determination to meet specified requirements. This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to those provisions.Digest Key

				  deny requests by providers prior to, retrospectively, or concurrent with the provision of health care services to insureds, based in whole or in part on medical necessity, every insurer subject to this section shall meet the following requirements:(1) Decisions to approve, modify, or deny, based on medical necessity, requests by providers prior to, or concurrent with, the provision of health care services to insureds that do not meet the requirements for the 72-hour review required by paragraph (2), shall be made in a timely fashion appropriate for the nature of the insured’s condition, not to exceed five business days from the insurer’s receipt of the information reasonably necessary and requested by the insurer to make the determination. In cases where the review is retrospective, the decision shall be communicated to the individual who received services, or to the individual’s designee, within 30 days of the receipt of information that is
				  reasonably necessary to make this determination, and shall be communicated to the provider in a manner that is consistent with current law. For purposes of this section, retrospective reviews shall be for care rendered on or after January 1, 2000.(2) When the insured’s condition is such that the insured faces an imminent and serious threat to his or her health, including, but not limited to, the potential loss of life, limb, or other major bodily function, or the normal timeframe for the decisionmaking process, as described in paragraph (1), would be detrimental to the insured’s life or health or could jeopardize the insured’s ability to regain maximum function, decisions to approve, modify, or deny requests by providers prior to, or concurrent with, the provision of health care services to insureds shall be made in a timely fashion, appropriate for the nature of the insured’s condition, but not to exceed 72 hours after the insurer’s receipt
				  of the information reasonably necessary and requested by the insurer to make the determination.(3) Decisions to approve, modify, or deny requests by providers for authorization prior to, or concurrent with, the provision of health care services to insureds shall be communicated to the requesting provider within 24 hours of the decision.

In the case of concurrent review, care shall not be discontinued until the insured’s treating provider has been notified of the insurer’s decision and a care plan has been agreed upon by the treating provider that is appropriate for the medical needs of that
				  patient.(4) Communications regarding decisions to approve requests by providers prior to, retrospectively, or concurrent with the provision of health care services to insureds shall specify the specific health care service approved. Responses regarding decisions to deny, delay, or modify health care services requested by providers prior to, retrospectively, or concurrent with the provision of health care services to insureds shall be communicated to insureds in writing, and to providers initially by telephone or facsimile, except with regard to decisions rendered retrospectively, and then in writing, and shall include a clear and concise explanation of the reasons for the insurer’s decision, a description of the criteria or guidelines used, and the clinical reasons for the decisions regarding medical necessity. Any written communication to a physician or other health care provider of a denial, delay, or modification or a request shall include
				  the name and telephone number of the health care professional responsible for the denial, delay, or modification. The telephone number provided shall be a direct number or an extension, to allow the physician or health care provider easily to contact the professional responsible for the denial, delay, or modification. Responses shall also include information as to how the provider or the insured may file an appeal with the insurer or seek department review under the unfair practices provisions of Article 6.5 (commencing with Section 790) of Chapter 1 of Part 2 of Division 1 and the regulations adopted thereunder.(5) If the insurer cannot make a decision to approve, modify, or deny the request for authorization within the timeframes specified in paragraph (1) or (2) because the insurer is not in receipt of all of the information reasonably necessary and requested, or because the insurer requires consultation by an expert reviewer, or because
				  the insurer has asked that an additional examination or test be performed upon the insured, provided that the examination or test is reasonable and consistent with good medical practice, the insurer shall, immediately upon the expiration of the timeframe specified in paragraph (1) or (2), or as soon as the insurer becomes aware that it will not meet the timeframe, whichever occurs first, notify the provider and the insured, in writing, that the insurer cannot make a decision to approve, modify, or deny the request for authorization within the required timeframe, and specify the information requested but not received, or the expert reviewer to be consulted, or the additional examinations or tests required. The insurer shall also notify the provider and enrollee of the anticipated date on which a decision may be rendered. Upon receipt of all information reasonably necessary and requested by the insurer, the insurer shall approve, modify, or deny the request for authorization within the timeframes specified in
				  paragraph (1) or (2), whichever applies.(6) If the commissioner determines that an insurer has failed to meet any of the timeframes in this section, or has failed to meet any other requirement of this section, the commissioner may assess, by order, administrative penalties for each failure. A proceeding for the issuance of an order assessing administrative penalties shall be subject to appropriate notice to, and an opportunity for a hearing with regard to, the person affected. The administrative penalties shall not be deemed an exclusive remedy for the commissioner. These penalties shall be paid to the Insurance Fund.(i) Every insurer subject to this section shall maintain telephone access for providers to request authorization for health care services.(j) Nothing in this section shall cause a disability
				  health insurer to be defined as a health care provider for purposes of any provision of law, including, but not limited to, Section 6146 of the Business and Professions Code, Sections 3333.1 and 3333.2 of the Civil Code, and Sections 340.5, 364, 425.13, 667.7, and 1295 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
