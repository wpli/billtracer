						HuffmanFebruary 27, 2009 An act to amend Sections 12509 and 12814.6 of, and to add Section 12811.2 to, the Vehicle Code, relating to vehicles. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1220, as introduced, Huffman.
											  Vehicles: supervised driving: young drivers.(1) Existing law allows a person with an instructional permit issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles to generally operate a motor vehicle when accompanied and supervised by a California licensed driver who, among other things, is 18 years of age or over and whose driving privilege is not on probation. A violation of these provisions is an infraction.This bill would additionally require that the supervising licensed driver have held his or her license for at least one year. (2) Existing law requires the department, upon proper application, to issue driver’s licenses to persons 18 years of age or older who meet specified criteria.This bill would require, on and after January 1, 2011, for a driver’s license to be issued to a person at least 18 years of age but under 25 years of age, the
		person to complete 50 hours of supervised driving practice, not less that 10 of which is required to include driving during darkness. The bill would require the person to record and maintain a supervised driving log, provided by the department, in the vehicle while the person is practicing. Upon application for a driver’s license, the person would be required to submit to the department the supervised driving log, certifying that the applicant has completed the required amount of driving practice and is prepared to take the department’s driving test.(3) Existing law, the Brady-Jared Teen Driver Safety Act of 1997, allows for the issuance of a driver’s license to a person at least 16 years of age but under 18 years of age pursuant to the provisional licensing program. Under the act, licensees are required to meet specified requirements, driver education, and training, and are prohibited during the first 12 months after issuance of a license
		from driving during the hours of 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. or from transporting passengers who are under 20 years of age, except as provided. A violation of these provisions is an infraction.This bill would require a person at least 16 years of age but under 18 years of age who is eligible for a driver’s license issued pursuant to the provisional licensing program to record and maintain a supervised driving log in the vehicle while the person is practicing. Because these provisions would create new crimes, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.(4) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that no
		reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.Digest Key

                                YES  Bill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:(a) Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for teenage drivers between 15 and 20 years of age, accounting for 13 percent of all fatal crashes according to statistics compiled by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.(b) On a per population basis, drivers under 25 years of age have the highest rate of involvement in fatal crashes of any age group according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.(c) According to the University of California, Berkeley Traffic Safety Center 2006 Report: Teens and Driving in
		  California – Summary of Research and Best Practices, teenagers in California have the highest average annual collision and traffic offense rate. Per mile driven, their crash rate is four times that of other drivers.(d) Many teens are waiting until they are 18 years of age to get their driver’s license. The number of provisional licenses issued per year for persons 16 and 17 years of age is steadily decreasing despite an increase in population in California.(e) California does not require any person 18 years of age or older to take driver education or driver training to obtain a driver’s license.(f) Although still high, crash rates for 16- and 17-year old drivers are declining with the enactment of the Brady-Jared Teen Driver Safety Act of 1997, but crash rates among 18 year olds are increasing.(g) Brain development research indicates that the decisionmaking part of the brain is not fully developed until 25 years of age. The frontal cortex regulates impulse control, judgment, problem solving, and emotional processing, all which affect decisions behind the wheel, according to the University of California Berkeley Traffic Safety Center 2006 Report.(h) Fatalities and collision rates drop significantly after 25 years of age according to the Department of the California Highway Patrol 2006 Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System.(i) Research shows that practice behind the wheel dramatically reduces crash rates for new drivers. The crash risk drops by more than two-thirds after the first 1,000 to 1,500 miles of independent driving.(j) Eighteen
		  to 24 year olds would be safer drivers as a result of taking a driver awareness program designed to teach drivers about the dangers facing young motorists and how to remain safe on the road.(k) The National Safety Council, a leader in driver improvement training for more than 40 years, developed Defensive Driving Course, a highly interactive young driver intervention program in which the instructor plays the role of facilitator, to specifically target drivers between 16 and 24 years of age.(l) Defensive Driving Course teaches young adults that people in their age group are more likely to be hurt or killed in a vehicle crash; inexperience, distractions, and peer pressure cause unique driving hazards; speeding, alcohol, and “party drugs” greatly increase their risk of injury or death; as a driver or passenger, they can greatly reduce their risk by taking control; and committing to
		  changing their driving behavior makes personal, legal, and financial sense.SEC. 2. Section 12509 of the Vehicle Code is amended to read:12509. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (f) of Section 12514, the department, for good cause, may issue an instruction permit to any physically and mentally qualified person who meets one of the following requirements and who applies to the department for an instruction permit:(1) Is age 15 years and 6 months or older, and has successfully completed approved courses in automobile driver education and driver training as provided in paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) of Section 12814.6.(2) Is age 15 years and 6 months or older, and has successfully completed an approved course in automobile driver education and is taking driver training as provided in
				  paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) of Section 12814.6.(3) Is age 15 years and 6 months and enrolled and participating in an integrated driver education and training program as provided in subparagraph (B) of paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) of Section 12814.6.(4) Is over the age of 16 years and is applying for a restricted driver’s license pursuant to Section 12814.7.(5) Is over the age of 17 years and 6 months.(b) The applicant shall qualify for, and be issued, an instruction permit within 12 months from the date of the application.(c) An instruction permit issued pursuant to subdivision (a) shall entitle the applicant to operate a vehicle, subject to the limitations imposed by this
				  section and any other provisions of law, upon the highways for a period not exceeding 24 months from the date of the application.(d) Except as provided in Section 12814.6, a person, while having in his or her immediate possession a valid permit issued pursuant to paragraphs (1) to (3), inclusive, of subdivision (a), may operate a motor vehicle, other than a motorcycle, motorized scooter, or a motorized bicycle, when accompanied by, and under the immediate supervision of, a California licensed driver with a valid license of the appropriate class, 18 years of age or over older whose driving privilege is not on probation and who has held a valid license for at least one year.
				  Except as provided in subdivision (e), an accompanying licensed driver at all times shall occupy a position within the driver’s compartment that would enable the accompanying licensed driver to assist the person in controlling the vehicle as may be necessary to avoid a collision and to provide immediate guidance in the safe operation of the vehicle.(e) A person, while having in his or her immediate possession a valid permit issued pursuant to paragraphs (1) to (3), inclusive, of subdivision (a), who is age 15 years and 6 months or older and who has successfully completed approved courses in automobile education and driver training as provided in paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) of Section 12814.6, and a person, while having in his or her immediate possession a valid permit issued pursuant to subdivision (a), who is age 17 years and 6 months or older, may, in addition to operating a motor vehicle pursuant to subdivision (d), also operate a
				  motorcycle, motorized scooter, or a motorized bicycle, except that the person shall not operate a motorcycle, motorized scooter, or a motorized bicycle during hours of darkness, shall stay off any freeways that have full control of access and no crossings at grade, and shall not carry any passenger except an instructor licensed under Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 11100) of Division 5 of this code or a qualified instructor as defined in Section 41907 of the Education Code.(f) A person, while having in his or her immediate possession a valid permit issued pursuant to paragraph (4) of subdivision (a), may only operate a government-owned motor vehicle, other than a motorcycle, motorized scooter, or a motorized bicycle, when taking a driver training instruction administered by the California National Guard.(g) The department may also issue an instruction permit to a person who
				  has been issued a valid driver’s license to authorize the person to obtain driver training instruction and to practice that instruction in order to obtain another class of driver’s license or an endorsement.(h) The department may further restrict permits issued under subdivision (a) as it may determine to be appropriate to assure the safe operation of a motor vehicle by the permittee.SEC. 3. Section 12811.2 is added to the Vehicle Code, to read:12811.2.  On and after January 1, 2011, a driver’s license shall only be issued to a person at least 18 years of age but under 25 years of age if the person has completed 50 hours of supervised driving practice. Not less than 10 of the required practice hours shall include driving during darkness, as defined in Section 280. The person shall record and maintain a supervised driving log, provided by the department, in the vehicle while the person is practicing. Upon application for a driver’s license, the person shall submit to the department the supervised driving log, certifying that the applicant has completed the required amount of driving practice and is prepared to take the department’s driving test. This requirement does not apply to motorcycle practice.SEC. 4. Section 12814.6 of the Vehicle Code is amended to read:12814.6. (a) Except as provided in Section 12814.7, a driver’s license issued to a person at least 16 years of age but under 18 years of age shall be issued pursuant to the provisional licensing program contained in this section. The program shall consist of all of the following components:(1) Upon application for an original license, the applicant shall be issued an instruction permit pursuant to Section 12509. A person who has in his or her immediate possession a valid permit issued pursuant to Section 12509 may operate a motor vehicle, other than a motorcycle or motorized bicycle, only when the person is either taking the driver training instruction referred to in paragraph (3) or practicing that instruction, provided the person
				  is accompanied by, and is under the immediate supervision of, a California licensed driver 25 years of age or older whose driving privilege is not on probation. The age requirement of this paragraph does not apply if the licensed driver is the parent, spouse, or guardian of the permitholder or is a licensed or certified driving instructor.(2) The person shall hold an instruction permit for not less than six months prior to applying for a provisional driver’s license.(3) The person shall have complied with one of the following:(A) Satisfactory completion of approved courses in automobile driver education and driver training maintained pursuant to provisions of the Education Code in any secondary school of California, or equivalent instruction in a secondary school of another state.(B) Satisfactory completion of an integrated driver education and training program that is approved by the department and conducted by a driving instructor licensed under Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 11100) of Division 5. The program shall utilize segmented modules, whereby a portion of the educational instruction is provided by, and then reinforced through, specific behind-the-wheel training before moving to the next phase of driver education and training. The program shall contain a minimum of 30 hours of classroom instruction and six hours of behind-the-wheel training.(C) Satisfactory completion of six hours or more of behind-the-wheel instruction by a driving school or an independent driving instructor licensed under Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 11100) of Division 5 and either an accredited course in automobile driver education in any secondary school of California

To be acceptable to the department, the professional instruction shall meet minimum standards to be prescribed by the department, and the standards shall be at least equal to the requirements for driver education and driver training contained in the rules and regulations adopted by the State Board of Education pursuant to the Education Code. A person who has complied with this subdivision shall not be required by the governing board of a school district to comply with subparagraph (A) in order to graduate from high school.(D) Except as provided under subparagraph (B), a student may not take driver training instruction, unless he or she has successfully completed driver education.(4) The person shall complete 50 hours of supervised driving
				  practice prior to the issuance of a provisional license, which is in addition to any other driver training instruction required by law. Not less than 10 of the required practice hours shall include driving during darkness, as defined in Section 280. The person shall record and maintain a supervised driving log, provided by the department, in the vehicle while the person is practicing.
