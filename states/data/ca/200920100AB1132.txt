						Runner)February 27, 2009 An act to amend Section 12811 of, and to add Section 4150.3 to, the Vehicle Code, relating to anatomical gifts. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1132, Jones.
											  Vehicle registration: organ and tissue donation.Existing law, the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act, regulates the making of anatomical gifts and the disposition of donated bodies and body parts.Existing law authorizes the creation of a nonprofit entity designated as the California Organ and Tissue Donor Registrar, which is required to establish and maintain the California Organ and Tissue Donor Registry.Existing law requires the Department of Motor Vehicles, upon issuance of a new driver’s license or a renewal of a driver’s license or the issuance of an identification card, to provide information on organ and tissue donation, including a standardized form to be filled out by an individual who desires to enroll in the California Organ and Tissue Donor Registry with instructions for mailing the completed form to the California Organ and Tissue Donor Registrar, and including a donor dot that may be affixed to the new driver’s
		license or identification card. Existing law also provides that a person who applies for an original or renewal driver’s license or identification card may designate a voluntary contribution of $2 for the purpose of promoting and supporting organ and tissue donation. Existing law authorizes the department to use these contributions to cover its actual administrative costs incurred pursuant to this organ and tissue donor registration program.This bill would authorize the department to use not more than $300,000 of the contributions collected under these mail in enrollment registration provisions per year to cover its related actual administrative costs.This bill would also require the department to add a graphic hyperlink to the confirmation page of vehicle registrations processed online in order to provide the
		option for drivers to connect to the state-authorized Donate Life California online California Organ and Tissue Donor Registry and would authorize a person, upon renewal of a vehicle registration online to designate a voluntary contribution, as specified, to the registry for the purpose of promoting and supporting organ and tissue donation.Digest Key

The license shall state the class of license for which the licensee has qualified and shall contain the distinguishing number assigned to the applicant, the date of expiration, the true full name, age, and mailing address of the licensee, a brief description and engraved picture or photograph of the licensee for the purpose of identification, and space for the signature of the licensee.(B) Each license shall also contain a space for the endorsement of a record of each suspension or revocation thereof.(C) The department shall use whatever process or processes, in the issuance of engraved or colored licenses, that prohibit, as near as possible, the ability to alter or reproduce the license, or prohibit the ability to superimpose a picture or photograph on the license without ready detection.(2) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (1), a license issued to a person under 18 years of age shall display the words “provisional until age 18.”(b) (1) The front of an application for an original or renewal of a driver’s license or identification card shall contain a space for an applicant to give his or her consent to be an organ and tissue donor upon death.

				  statement: “If you marked on the front of the application that you want to be an organ and tissue donor upon death, your consent shall serve as a legally binding document as outlined under the California Uniform Anatomical Gift Act. Except in the case where the donor is under the age of 18, the donation does not require the consent of any other person. For donors under the age of 18, the legal guardian of the donor shall make the final decision regarding the donation. If you want to change your decision to consent in the future, or if you want to limit the donation to specific organs, tissues, or research, you must contact Donate Life California by mail at 1760 Creekside Oaks Drive, #220, Sacramento, CA 95833, or online at www.donateLIFEcalifornia.org, or www.doneVIDAcalifornia.org.” (2) Notwithstanding any other law, a person under 18 years of age may register as a donor.
