											  California State University and University of California: alumni: disclosure.(1) Existing law establishes the California State University, administered by the Trustees of the California State University, and the University of California, administered by the Regents of the University of California, as 2 of the segments of public postsecondary education in this state. Existing law establishes the Hastings College of the Law, under the governance of the Board of Directors of the Hastings College of the Law, within the University of California.Existing law prescribes criteria for the disclosure of the names and addresses of alumni of the California State University, the University of California, and the Hastings College of the Law. Existing law requires that the names, addresses, and electronic mail addresses of alumni be disclosed only to provide those persons with informational materials relating to the California State University, the University of California, and the
		Hastings College of the Law, and its programs and activities; to provide those persons, or the trustees, auxiliary organizations of the California State University, as defined, or the Regents of the University of California, the Board of Directors of the Hastings College of the Law, or the alumni associations with beneficial commercial opportunities; or to promote and support the educational mission of the California State University, the University of California, the trustees, the regents, the Board of Directors of the Hastings College of the Law, or the alumni associations.Existing law authorizes this disclosure only if the trustees, auxiliary organizations, or the alumni associations, in the case of the California State University, or the regents, the board of directors, or the alumni associations, in the case of the University of California and the Hastings College of the Law, have a written agreement with a business, as defined, that maintains control over
		this data that requires the business to maintain the confidentiality of the names, addresses, and electronic mail addresses of the alumni, that requires that the university or the college retain the right to approve or reject any purpose for which the private information is to be used by the business and to review and approve the text of mailings sent to alumni, and that prohibits the business from using the information for any purposes other than those described, and the disclosure of alumni names, addresses, and electronic mail addresses does not include the names and addresses of alumni who have directed the trustees, the regents, the board of directors, or an alumni association or auxiliary organization, not to disclose their names, addresses, or electronic mail addresses.Existing law requires the California State University, the University of California, and the Hastings College of the Law to make available to its alumni a specified form or an alternative
		notice, including specified information, in a mailing or in an Internet posting, as prescribed, before alumni names, addresses, and electronic mail addresses may be disclosed.This bill would require the form to be provided to alumni through a link on the homepage of the Internet Web site of the alumni association or in the alumni association’s privacy policy.The bill would also express the intent of the Legislature that, by July 1, 2014, the California State University, the University of California, and the Hastings College of the Law submit reports to the Legislature regarding compliance with these provisions.(2) Under existing law, these provisions are applicable to the University of California and the Hastings College of the Law only to the extent that the regents or the board of directors act, by resolution, to make them applicable.Existing law specifies that these provisions are repealed as of January 1, 2011.This bill would extend those repeal dates to January 1, 2016.Digest Key
