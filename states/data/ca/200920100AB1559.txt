			(Monning (Chair), Eng, Furutani, Ma, and Portantino)
			March 11, 2009 An act to amend Section 14206 of, and to add Section 14021 to, the Unemployment Insurance Code, relating to unemployment insurance. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1559, Committee on Labor and Employment.
										Workforce development: summer youth job training.Existing law, the California Workforce Investment Act, establishes the California Workforce Investment Board (CWIB), which is the body responsible for assisting the Governor in the development, oversight, and continuous improvement of California’s workforce investment system, and prescribes the functions and duties of the board.This bill would require the CWIB, in collaboration with local workforce investment boards, to establish the California Youth at Work Program, for the purpose of providing summer job training and work experience opportunities for youth in the state, in accordance with specified requirements. The bill would provide that the program shall only be implemented if the Director of Finance determines that there are sufficient federal funds made available to the state for the program pursuant to the American Recovery and
		Reinvestment Act of 2009 or other federal law, and would require that the program terminate at such time that the director determines that there are no longer sufficient federal funds available for the program.Existing law requires the local chief elected officials in a local workforce development area to form, pursuant to specified guidelines established by the Governor and the board, a local workforce investment board, and prescribes the duties of the board with regard to the development and implementation of local workforce investment plans, as specified.This bill would
		require the local board to also facilitate the implementation of summer youth training programs through partnerships and effective collaboration. Because the bill imposes new duties on local workforce investment boards with respect to the implementation of these programs, it would impose a state-mandated local program.The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.Digest Key

The program shall be established in accordance with the following requirements:(1) The program shall include a work experience component that conforms to the federal Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (29 U.S.C. Sec. 2801 et seq.), and its implementing regulations, as prescribed in 20 C.F.R. 664.460 (WIA).(2) Eligible youth who participate in the program shall be between 14 years of age and 24 years of age.(3) The program shall primarily focus on providing summer job training and work experience opportunities for youth in the state. For purposes of this section, the period of “summer” shall be from May 1 through September 30 of each year. However, program start and end dates may vary within this time period.(4) Program services shall target low-income youth and certain youth populations facing barriers to employment, including, but not limited to, youth in foster care, and youth who have aged out of foster care, youth whose families are enrolled in the CalWORKs (Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 11200) of Part 3 of Division 9 of the Welfare and Institutions Code) program and
				  youth who themselves are enrolled in the CalWORKs program, homeless youth, and youth with disabilities. Military veterans and their spouses who are under 24 years of age shall also be given priority for services under the program.(5) The program shall, to the extent feasible and appropriate, incorporate work-based learning strategies, work experience, and other activities that involve exposing youth to industrial job sector opportunities that are key to the economic region. Local workforce investment boards may work with the board to integrate kindergarten and grades 1 to 12, inclusive, and postsecondary education and teaching opportunities, as are deemed appropriate.(6) Wages or stipends may be provided to youth in a classroom-based component of a summer employment opportunity. Local workforce investment boards shall collaborate with the board to develop policies guiding the
				  payment of those classroom-based wages and stipends.(7) Minors under 18 years of age who are enrolled in the program shall be paid at least the minimum wage and applicable overtime rates established by the state’s Industrial Welfare Commission (IWC).(8) High school graduates or those persons holding an equivalent degree shall be paid at a level commensurate with adults doing the same job, when those individuals perform the same quantity, quality, and classification of work.(b) The board, in consultation with local workforce investment boards, shall request, and, if required, obtain any necessary waivers from the United States Department of Labor, to ensure effective and efficient implementation of the program set forth in this section.(c) The program established by the section shall only be implemented if the Director of Finance determines that there are sufficient federal funds made available to the state for expenditure for the program pursuant to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5) or other federal law, and shall terminate at such time that the director determines that there are no longer sufficient federal funds available for the program.SEC. 2. Section 14206 of the Unemployment Insurance Code is amended to read:14206. The local board shall do all of the following:(a) Coordinate workforce investment activities in the local area with economic development strategies.(b) Promote participation of private sector employers in the local workforce investment system.(c) Develop and submit a local workforce investment plan to the Governor.(d) Select one-stop operators, with the agreement of the local chief elected official, annually review their operations, and terminate for cause the eligibility of those operators.(e) Award grants or contracts to eligible providers of youth activities in the local area on a competitive basis, consistent with the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA), based upon the recommendations of the youth council.(f) Identify, consistent with the
				  WIA, eligible providers of training services.(g) Identify eligible providers of intensive services and, when the one-stop operator does not provide intensive services to the local area, award contracts to those providers.(h) Develop local policy on the amount and duration of individual training accounts based upon the market rate for local training programs.(i) Conduct program oversight over workforce investment activities in the local area.(j) Negotiate with the local chief elected official in the local area and the Governor on local performance measures for the local area.(k) Assist in the development of a statewide employment statistics system, which shall
				  be developed in conjunction with and shall utilize to the fullest extent possible, the Employment Development Department’s labor market information system.(l) Facilitate the implementation of summer youth training programs through partnerships and effective collaboration.SEC. 3. If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.
