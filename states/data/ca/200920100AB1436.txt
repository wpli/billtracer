						LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1436, Portantino.
											  Postsecondary educational institutions: meetings: live audio transmission.Existing law, intended to strengthen existing accountability requirements, requires the California Postsecondary Education Commission, each November 15, to submit a higher education report to the Legislature and the Governor that provides information to the citizens of the state on the significant indicators of performance of the public colleges and universities.This bill would require the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, the Trustees of the California State University, the California Postsecondary Education Commission, and the Student Aid Commission, including any auxiliary organization, to provide for live audio transmission of all meetings, which are open to the public
		pursuant to specified law, through a technology that is accessible to as large a segment of the public as possible. This bill would also request the Regents of the University of California to comply with these provisions.Digest Key
