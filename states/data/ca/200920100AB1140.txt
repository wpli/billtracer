LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1140, as amended, Niello.
											  California Private Postsecondary Education Act of 2009: flight schools and aircraft maintenance programs. 2009.Existing(1) Existing law establishes the California Private Postsecondary Education Act of 2009, which, among other things, provides for student protections and regulatory oversight of private postsecondary schools in the state. Existing law establishes the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education to regulate private postsecondary institutions through the powers granted, and the duties imposed, by the act.This bill would prohibit the bureau, for the period July 1, 2010, to July 1, 2011, inclusive, from enforcing the act against
		institutions that offer flight instruction or institutions that offer Federal Aviation Administration certified educational programs in aircraft maintenance. The bill would also require the Legislature to hold public informational hearings for the purpose of reviewing the appropriateness of regulating educational programs in flight instruction and aircraft maintenance under the act those institutions to notify the bureau if they operate during that period.(2) The act prohibits institutions, as defined, from performing various actions.This bill would prohibit an institution from offering an unaccredited doctoral degree program
		without disclosing to prospective students that the degree program is unaccredited, and any known limitation of the unaccredited degree, including, but not limited to, whether the degree is recognized for licensure or certification in other states.(3) The act prohibits an ability-to-benefit student, defined as a student who does not have a certificate of graduation from a school providing secondary education, or a recognized equivalent of that certificate, from enrolling in an institution unless the student achieves a specified score on an independently administered examination from a specified list of examinations prescribed by the United States Department of Education that demonstrates that the student may benefit from the education and training being offered.This bill would authorize the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education to publish its own list of acceptable examinations if the United
		States Department of Education does not have a list of relevant examinations that pertain to the intended occupational training.(4) The act requires specified private postsecondary institutions to refund 100% of the amount paid for institutional charges, less specified expenses, if notice of cancellation is made through attendance at the first class session, or the 7th class day after enrollment, whichever is later.This bill would change the 2nd deadline for notice of cancellation from the 7th class day after enrollment to the 7th day after enrollment.(5) Existing law defines “graduates employed in the field,” for purposes of the act, as graduates who are gainfully employed within 6 months of graduation in a position for which the skills obtained through the education and training provided by the institution are required or provided a
		significant advantage to the graduate in obtaining the position.This bill would revise this definition to remove skills obtained that have provided a significant advantage to the graduate in obtaining the position, and include skills that are utilized to perform the purpose or objective of the position or the major responsibilities of the position.(6) Existing law appropriates $580,000 from the Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education Administration Fund to the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education, for the purpose of funding 5 private postsecondary education specialist and senior specialist positions.This bill would require those positions to be permanent, full-time positions to perform work in conformity with the classification specifications as directed by the bureau chief.This (7) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.Digest Key
