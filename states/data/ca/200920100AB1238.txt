											  Advanced placement program.(1) Existing law contains legislative findings and declarations regarding advanced placement courses. Existing law states the intent of the Legislature that certain state funding that is currently provided to school districts be made available to provide financial assistance to economically disadvantaged pupils in the payment of advanced placement examination fees. Existing law further states the intent of the Legislature that a competitive grant program also be established for the purpose of awarding grants to economically disadvantaged pupils to cover the costs of advanced placement examination fees, thereby creating a second source of financial assistance for economically disadvantaged pupils taking advanced placement examinations.This bill would require school districts maintaining any of grades 9 to 12, inclusive, to offer
		at each of these schools advanced placement courses in certain areas of study, including English literature and composition, United States history, Spanish language, calculus, and chemistry. The bill would authorize small rural school districts, as defined, to offer online courses for the purposes of fulfilling this requirement. Because the bill would require school districts to provide a higher level of service, it would impose a state-mandated local program English, history, foreign language, mathematics, and science. The bill would state the intent of the Legislature that school districts consider alternative means of providing advanced placement courses if an advanced placement certified teacher is not available or if fewer than 10 pupils are enrolled in any given course. The bill would authorize these
		alternative means to include high-quality online courses, and would require that these high-quality online courses meet certain requirements and specifications.(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.Digest Key
