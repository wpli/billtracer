						LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1191, Conway.
											  Alcoholic beverages: proof of age: passports.The Alcoholic Beverage Control Act makes it a misdemeanor for any person under the age of 21 years to purchase any alcoholic beverage or consume any alcoholic beverage in any on‑sale premises. The act also subjects a holder of a license to sell alcoholic beverages to criminal prosecution and suspension or revocation of that license if the licensee sells any alcoholic beverages to any person under 21 years of age. Existing law provides that a licensee’s acceptance of bona fide evidence, as defined, constitutes a defense to any action against the licensee. This bill would authorize the acceptance of a valid passport, issued by the United States government or a foreign government, as bona fide evidence that a person is 21 years of age or older. This bill makes findings and
		declarations with regard to the importance of tourism to California.This bill would incorporate changes made by AB 59 that would become operative if both bills are enacted and this bill is enacted after AB 59.Digest Key
