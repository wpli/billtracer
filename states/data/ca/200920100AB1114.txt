						Ashburn)February 27, 2009 An act to add Section 503.5 to the Public Resources Code, relating to the Department of Parks and Recreation parks and recreation, and making an appropriation therefor. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1114, as amended, Gilmore.
											  Department of Parks and Recreation. Parks and recreation: grant funding: liquidating encumbrances.The Budget Act of 2004 reappropriated specified money from the Budget Act of 2002, which originally appropriated the money from the California Clean Water, Clean Air, Safe Neighborhood Parks, and Coastal Protection Fund, established by the California Clean Water, Clean Air, Safe Neighborhood Parks, and Coastal Protection Act of 2002 (Proposition 40) for the deposit of specified bond funds, to the Department of Parks and Recreation for urban park grants and Murray-Hayden competitive grants. The Budget Act of 2004 provided that the period for liquidating the encumbrances of the reapportioned moneys was extended to June 30, 2010. Proposition 40 requires specified grant funds provided under Proposition 40 that have not been expended by the grant recipient prior to July 1, 2011, to revert to the fund and be available for appropriation by the Legislature for one or more of specified local
		assistance programs that the Legislature determines to be the highest priority statewide.This bill would extend the period to liquidate the encumbrances to June 30, 2011, rather than June 30, 2010, for 2 specified grants totalling $3,039,000 and received by the Community Action Partnership of Kern County. By extending the time in which money encumbered under an existing appropriation may be expended, the bill would make an appropriation.Existing law establishes the Department of Parks and Recreation in the Natural Resources Agency. Existing law states that the department has control of the state park system and imposes various responsibilities on the department with respect to parks and recreation.This bill would declare that the primary function of the department is to provide services to those persons who use facilities that are operated by the department for camping or other outdoor recreational experiences.Digest Key
