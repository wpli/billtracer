						LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1442, Committee on Water, Parks and Wildlife.
										Fish and game: oil spills: wildlife rehabilitation.(1) Existing law provides for reciprocal agreements with adjoining states with regard to fishing rights and law enforcement.This bill would authorize the Director of Fish and Game, or a designated representative, to enter into reciprocal operational agreements with authorized representatives of any Oregon, Nevada, or Arizona state law enforcement agency to promote expeditious and effective law enforcement service to the public, and assistance between the members of the department and those agencies, in areas adjacent to the borders of this state and each of the adjoining states. The bill would deem any regularly employed law enforcement officer of an Oregon, Nevada, or Arizona state law enforcement agency a peace officer in this state, if specified conditions are met. (2) Existing
		law generally requires the Director of Finance to approve every gift or dedication to the state of personal property, or every gift to the state of real property in fee or in any lesser estate or interest, unless the Legislature specifically provides that approval is not required.This bill would authorize the Department of Fish and Game to seek and accept grants and donations from private and public organizations and agencies for the purpose of administering the Canine (K9) Program.(3) Existing law requires each person who takes birds or mammals in California to apply for, and be granted, a hunting license and requires any person who applies for a hunting license to meet specified requirements. Existing law requires each person 16 years of age or older who takes fish, reptiles, or amphibia in California to apply for, and be granted a fishing license and requires any person who applies for a fishing
		license to meet specified requirements.This bill would authorize the department to issue collectible, commemorative licenses to any person for the purposes of promoting and supporting licensed hunting, fishing, and resource conservation. The bill would authorize the department to issue and sell fish and game warden stamps to support fish and game wardens. (4) Existing law requires the Wildlife Conservation Board to investigate, study, and determine which streams and lakes are suitable for, or can be made suitable for, fishing, hunting, and shooting.This bill would require the board to determine which streams and lakes are suitable for, or can be made suitable for, fishing and hunting. The bill would require the Department of Fish and Game, in determining which areas are suitable for fishing and hunting, to take into consideration areas of the state where
		public access and opportunity for fishing and hunting are most needed.(5) Existing law authorizes the Wildlife Conservation Board to authorize the Department of Fish and Game to lease degraded potential wildlife habitat real property for specified purposes to nonprofit organizations or public agencies if the lessee agrees to restore the real property to its highest possible wildlife habitat value and maintain the real property at that value.This bill would authorize the board, during the period of lease, to require that the real property be open to the public for compatible recreational opportunities.(6) The Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley Wetlands Mitigation Bank Act of 1993 provides for the establishment of wetlands mitigation bank sites to increase the total wetlands acreage and values within the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley. The act
		prohibits bank sites from being qualified under the act on or after January 1, 2010.This bill would extend that date to January 1, 2015.(7) Under existing law, except as expressly provided otherwise, any violation of the Fish and Game Code, or of any rule, regulation, or order made or adopted under the code, is a misdemeanor.This bill would provide that it is unlawful to violate specific regulations adopted by the department and the commission, thereby imposing a state-mandated local program by creating new crimes. (8) Existing law makes it unlawful to intentionally discharge any firearm or release any arrow or crossbow bolt over or across any public road or way open to the public, in an unsafe manner. This bill would make it unlawful to intentionally discharge any firearm or release any arrow or crossbow bolt over or across any public road or other established way open to the public in an unsafe and reckless manner. The bill would, except as specified, make it unlawful for a person to remove a collar from a hunting dog, as defined, without possessing written permission from the dog’s owner allowing the removal of the collar.(9) Existing law allows specified state and federal officials to take certain mammals involved in dangerous disease outbreaks.This bill would additionally authorize county officials to take mammals pursuant to that provision upon the approval of, and in a manner approved by, the Director of Fish and Game, or his or her designee. (10) Under existing law, it is unlawful for
		any person to fish with 2 rods without first obtaining a second-rod sport fishing validation, in addition to a valid California sport fishing license validation, and having that validation affixed to his or her valid sport fishing license. Any person who has a second-rod validation may fish with 2 rods in inland waters in any sport fishery in which the regulations of the commission provide for the taking of fish by angling, except those waters in which only artificial lures or barbless hooks may be used.This bill would exclude the waters of the Smith River in Del Norte County from inland waters in which 2 rods can be used.(11) Existing law exempts a licensed fish importer from the requirement to obtain a fish wholesaler’s license.This bill would revise that provision to exempt from that requirement a licensed fish importer who only purchases or obtains fish
		from out of state.(12) Existing law regulates the Dungeness crab fishery and, among other things, permits the Director of the Department of Fish and Game to delay the opening of the fishery in specified situations and regulates the taking of crab during those delays. Existing law sets forth the qualifications for a Dungeness crab vessel permit, and provides that no person shall use a vessel to take, possess, or land Dungeness crab for commercial purposes without a Dungeness crab vessel permit. Existing law sets forth requirements for the issuance, transfer, and revocation of a Dungeness crab vessel permit, and specifies that the department shall charge a fee for each Dungeness crab vessel permit. Existing law requires the director to convene a Dungeness crab review panel for the purpose of reviewing permits and application transfers. Existing law provides that those provisions shall become inoperative on April 1, 2010, and, as of January 1,
		2011, are repealed.This bill would extend the operation of those provisions until April 1, 2012, and would repeal those provisions on January 1, 2013. Because this bill would extend the operation of the Dungeness crab permit program and thereby the crimes imposed for a violation of those provisions, the bill would create a state-mandated local program by creating new crimes.(13) Existing law governs the sea cucumber fishery in this state. Under existing law, sea cucumbers cannot be taken, possessed aboard a boat, or landed by a person for commercial purposes except under a valid sea cucumber permit issued by the Department of Fish and Game. The Fish and Game Commission is authorized to adopt regulations that it determines may reasonably be necessary to protect the sea cucumber resource and assure a sustainable sea cucumber fishery or to enhance enforcement activities. A violation of existing law or
		regulations adopted pursuant thereto is a crime. Existing law provides that those provisions shall become inoperative on April 1, 2010, and, as of January 1, 2011, are repealed.This bill would extend the operation of those provisions until April 1, 2015, and would repeal those provisions on January 1, 2016. Because this bill would extend the operation of the sea cucumber permit program and thereby the crimes imposed for a violation of those provisions, the bill would create a state-mandated local program by creating new crimes.(14) Existing law provides that the taking of a mammal or bird by a person for which a hunting license or tag, seal, or stamp is required without the person having in his or her possession the required license, tag, seal, or stamp is punishable by a fine of not less than $250 or more than $2,000 or as a misdemeanor, or both. Existing law authorizes a court to reduce the fine to
		$50 if the person produces in court a license, tag, or stamp issued to the person and valid at the time of the person’s arrest.This bill instead would authorize a court to reduce the charge to an infraction punishable by a fine of not less than $50 and not more than $250 if the person produces in court a license, tag, seal, or stamp issued to the person and valid at the time of the person’s arrest.(15) Under existing law, the violation of certain provisions of the code are subject to administrative penalties.This bill would authorize the department, after the expiration of the time period to appeal an administrative penalty, to apply to the clerk of the appropriate court for a judgment to collect the administrative civil penalty. (16) The
		Lempert-Keene-Seastrand Oil Spill Prevention and Response Act (act) generally requires the administrator for oil spill response, acting at the direction of the Governor, to implement activities relating to oil spill response, including drills and preparedness, and oil spill containment and cleanup, and to represent the state in any coordinated response efforts with the federal government. The act requires responsible parties, as defined, to fully mitigate adverse impacts to wildlife, fisheries, wildlife habitat, and fisheries habitat. Full mitigation is required to be provided by successfully carrying out environmental projects or funding restoration activities required by the administrator in carrying out projects. The act authorizes the administrator, if any significant wildlife rehabilitation is necessary, to require the responsible party to prepare and submit a wildlife rehabilitation plan.This bill would revise that wildlife rehabilitation plan provision to
		authorize the administrator to require the responsible party to prepare and submit to the administrator, and to implement, a wildlife rehabilitation plan.(17) The act defines “nonpersistent oil” to mean a petroleum-based oil, such as gasoline, diesel, or jet fuel, that has specified characteristics.This bill would delete diesel from that provision.(18) Existing law requires the Department of Fish and Game to seize all birds, mammals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians, or any part thereof, that have been unlawfully taken, possessed, sold, imported, or transported.This bill would revise that provision to also include plants and aquaculture animals and products, or any part thereof. The bill would make certain conforming changes to related provisions of existing law.(19) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.Digest Key

In determining where a spill or discharge is likely to spread, the director shall consult with the Administrator of the Office of Spill Prevention and Response. At the time of closure, the
				  department shall make all reasonable efforts to notify the public of the closure, including notification to commercial and recreational fishing organizations, and posting of warnings on public piers and other locations where subsistence fishing is known to occur. The department shall coordinate, when possible, with local and regional agencies and organizations to expedite public notification.(2) Closure pursuant to paragraph (1) is not required if, within 24 hours of notification of a spill or discharge, the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment finds that a public health threat does not or is unlikely to exist.(b) Within 48 hours of notification of a spill or discharge subject to subdivision (a), the director, in consultation with the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, shall make an assessment and determine all of the following:(1) The danger posed to the public from fishing in the area where the spill or discharge occurred or spread, and the danger of consuming fish taken in the area where the spill or discharge occurred or spread.(2) Whether the areas closed for the take of fish or shellfish should be expanded to prevent any potential take or consumption of any fish or shellfish that may have been contaminated by the spill or discharge.(3) The likely period for maintaining a closure on the take of fish and shellfish in order to prevent any possible contaminated fish or shellfish from being taken or consumed or other threats to human health.(c) Within 48 hours after receiving notification of a spill or discharge subject to subdivision (a), or as soon as is feasible, the
				  director, in consultation with the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, shall assess and determine the potential danger from consuming fish that have been contained in a recirculating seawater tank onboard a vessel that may become contaminated by the vessel’s movement through an area where the spill or discharge occurred or spread.(d) If the director finds in his or her assessment pursuant to subdivision (b) that there is no significant risk to the public or to the fisheries, the director may immediately reopen the closed area and waive the testing requirements of subdivisions (e) and (f).(e) Except under the conditions specified in subdivision (d), after complying with subdivisions (a) and (b), the director, in consultation with the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, but in no event more than seven days from the notification of the spill or
				  discharge, shall order expedited tests of fish and shellfish that would have been open for take for commercial, recreational, or subsistence purposes in the closed area if not for the closure, to determine the levels of contamination, if any, and whether the fish or shellfish is safe for human consumption.(f) (1) Within 24 hours of receiving a notification from the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment that no threat to human health exists from the spill or discharge or that no contaminant from the spill or discharge is present that could contaminate fish or shellfish, the director shall reopen the areas closed pursuant to this section. The director may maintain a closure in any remaining portion of the closed area where the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment finds contamination from the spill or discharge persists that may adversely affect human health.(2) The director, in consultation with the commission, may also maintain a closure in any remaining portion of the closed area where commercial fishing or aquaculture occurs and where the department determines, pursuant to this paragraph, that contamination from the spill or discharge persists that may cause the waste of commercial fish or shellfish as regulated by Section 7701.(g) To the extent feasible, the director shall consult with representatives of commercial and recreational fishing associations and subsistence fishing communities regarding the extent and duration of a closure, testing protocols, and findings. If a spill or discharge occurs within the lands governed by a Native American tribe or affects waters flowing through tribal lands, or tribal fisheries, the director shall consult with the affected tribal governments.(h) The director shall seek full reimbursement from the responsible party or parties for the spill or discharge for all reasonable costs incurred by the department in carrying out this section, including, but not limited to, all testing.SEC. 14. Section 7149.45 of the Fish and Game Code is amended to read:7149.45. (a) It is unlawful for any person to fish with two rods without first obtaining a second-rod sport fishing validation, in addition to a valid California sport fishing license validation, and having that validation affixed to his or her valid sport fishing license. Any person who has a valid second-rod sport fishing validation affixed to his or her valid sport fishing license may fish with two rods in inland waters in any sport fishery in which the regulations of the commission provide for the taking of fish by angling, except those waters in which only artificial lures or barbless hooks may be used and the waters of the Smith River in Del Norte County.(b) The department or an authorized license agent shall issue a
				  second-rod sport fishing validation upon payment of a base fee of seven dollars and fifty cents ($7.50) during the 1995 calendar year and subsequent years, as adjusted under Section 713.(c) This section applies only to licenses, permits, reservations, tags, and other entitlements issued through the Automated License Data System.SEC. 15. Section 8035 of the Fish and Game Code is amended to read:8035. (a) Except for a person exempt under Section 8030, any person who, for the purpose of resale to other than the ultimate consumer, purchases or obtains fish from another person, who is required to be licensed as a fish receiver, fish processor, fish importer, or fish wholesaler under this article, shall obtain a fish wholesaler’s license.(b) The annual fee for a fish wholesaler’s license is three hundred seventy-one dollars ($371).(c) This section does not apply to either of the following:(1) Persons required to have a marine aquaria receiver’s license pursuant to Section 8033.1.(2) Persons licensed pursuant to Section 8036 who only purchase or obtain fish from outside this state.SEC. 16. Section 8036 of the Fish and Game Code is amended to read:8036. (a) Any person who purchases or receives fish that are taken outside of this state and brought into this state by a person who is not a licensed commercial fisherman, for the purpose of resale to other than the ultimate consumer, shall obtain a fish importer’s license.

The delay in the opening shall not be later than January 15 of any year.(b) On or about November 1 of each year, the director may authorize one or more operators of commercial fishing vessels to take and land a limited number of Dungeness crab for the purpose of quality testing according to a testing program conducted by, or on behalf of, the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission or an entity approved by the department. The department shall not approve a testing program unless it is funded by the entity authorized to conduct the testing program. Crab taken pursuant to this section
				  shall not be sold; however, any edible crabmeat recovered from the crabs tested shall not be wasted and may be used for charitable purposes.(c) The director shall order the opening of the Dungeness crab season in Districts 6, 7, 8, and 9 on December 1 if the quality tests authorized in subdivision (b) indicate the Dungeness crabs are not soft-shelled or low quality. The entity authorized to conduct the approved testing program may test, or cause to be tested, crabs taken for quality and soft shells pursuant to the approved testing program. If the tests are conducted on or about November 1 and result in a finding that Dungeness crabs are soft-shelled or low quality, the director shall authorize a second test to be conducted on or about November 15 pursuant to the approved testing program. If the second test results in a finding that Dungeness crabs are soft-shelled or low quality, the director may order the season opening delayed for a period

This section does not apply to a commercially registered fishing vessel when it is being used solely to assist a permitted vessel transport or set traps.(b) A Dungeness crab vessel permit may be issued only to the following persons for use on qualifying vessels:(1) A person, who has a commercial fishing license issued pursuant to Section 7852 or Article 7 (commencing with Section
				  8030) of Chapter 1 that has not been suspended or revoked, who is the owner of a commercial fishing vessel that has been registered with the department pursuant to Section 7881 in each of the 1991–92, 1992–93, and 1993–94 permit years and a minimum of four landings in each of three Dungeness crab seasons in the period from November 1, 1984, to April 1, 1994, have been made from that vessel.

Not more than one Dungeness crab vessel permit shall be issued to any person qualifying under Section
				  8101 and all permits issued under Section 8101 shall, notwithstanding paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 8280.3, be nontransferable. A person qualifying for a permit under this paragraph shall have participated in the Dungeness crab fishery on or before March 31, 1994, as documented by landing receipts that were prepared in that person’s name for not less than four landings of Dungeness crab taken in a crab trap in a Dungeness crab season and were delivered to the department pursuant to Section 8046. No person shall be issued a permit under this paragraph if that person has been issued a permit under any other provision of this section for another vessel. For purposes of Section 8101, “participated in the fishery” means made not less than four landings of Dungeness crab taken by traps in that person’s name in one Dungeness crab season. The department shall separately identify permits issued pursuant to this paragraph and those permits shall become immediately null and void upon the death of the
				  permittee. The department shall not issue or renew any permit under this paragraph to a person if the person failed to meet the participation requirements of four landings in one season prior to April 1, 1994, or has been issued a Dungeness crab permit for a vessel under any other paragraph of this subdivision.(4) A person who has a commercial fishing license issued pursuant to Section 7852 that has not been suspended or revoked, who meets one of the following conditions:(A) The person held a Dungeness crab permit issued pursuant to Section 8280 as it read on April 1, 1994, and participated in the Dungeness crab fishery between November 1, 1984, and April 1, 1994, and is the owner of a vessel that has been registered with the department in each of the 1991–92, 1992–93, and 1993–94 permit years but did not make landings or the department records do not indicate a minimum of four
				  landings per season for three Dungeness crab seasons from that vessel or in that person’s name because of a partnership or other working arrangement where the person was working aboard another vessel engaged in the Dungeness crab fishery in California.(B) The person held a Dungeness crab permit issued under Section 8280 as it read on April 1, 1994, and is the owner of a commercial fishing vessel that has been registered with the department pursuant to Section 7881 in each of the 1991–92, 1992–93, and 1993–94 permit years and from which a minimum of four landings utilizing traps were made in at least one Dungeness crab season in the period between November 1, 1984, and April 1, 1994, and from which either four landings were made utilizing traps or landings in excess of 10,000 pounds were made utilizing traps in each of two other Dungeness crab seasons in that same period, as documented by landing receipts.(C) The person held a Dungeness crab vessel permit issued under Section 8280 as it read on April 1, 1994, or was an officer in a California corporation that was licensed pursuant to Article 7 (commencing with Section 8030) of Chapter 1 as of April 1, 1994, and began construction or reconstruction of a vessel on or before January 1, 1992, for the purpose of engaging in the Dungeness crab fishery, including the purchase of equipment and gear to engage in that fishery in California. A person may be issued a permit under this condition only if the person intended in good faith to participate in the California Dungeness crab fishery, a denial of a permit would create a financial hardship on that person, and, for purposes of determining financial hardship, the applicant is a nonresident and cannot participate with his or her vessel or vessels in the Dungeness crab fishery of another state because of that state’s limited entry or moratorium on the
				  issuance of permits for the taking of Dungeness crab.(5) A person who has a commercial fishing license issued pursuant to Section 7852 that has not been suspended or revoked, who held a Dungeness crab permit issued under Section 8280 as it read on April 1, 1994, who made a minimum of four landings of Dungeness crab taken by traps in each of three Dungeness crab seasons in the period from November 1, 1984, to April 1, 1994, in his or her name in this state from a vessel owned by that person, as documented by landing receipts, who, between April 1, 1991, and January 1, 1995, purchased, contracted to purchase, or constructed a vessel, not otherwise qualifying pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), or (4), who has continuously owned that vessel since its purchase or construction, and who either (A) has used that vessel for the taking of Dungeness crab in this state on or before March 31, 1995, as documented by one or more landing receipts delivered to
				  the department pursuant to Section 8046, or (B) intended in good faith, based on evidence that the department and the review panel may require, including investment in crab gear, to enter that vessel in this state’s Dungeness crab fishery not later than December 1, 1995. Not more than one permit may be issued to any one person under this paragraph.(6) A person who held a Dungeness crab permit issued under Section 8280 as it read on April 1, 1994, who made a minimum of four landings utilizing traps in this state in each of three Dungeness crab seasons in the period between November 1, 1984, and April 1, 1994, in his or her name from a vessel operated by that person as documented by landing receipts, who currently does not own a vessel in his or her name, and who has not sold or transferred a vessel otherwise qualifying for a permit under this section. A permit may be issued under this paragraph for a vessel not greater in size than the vessel
				  from which the previous landings were made, and, in no event, for a vessel of more than 60 feet in overall length, to be placed on a vessel that the person purchases or contracts for construction on or before April 1, 1996. A permit issued under this paragraph shall be nontransferable and shall not be used for a vessel not owned by that person, and shall be revoked if the person (A) fails to renew the permit or annually renew his or her commercial fishing license issued pursuant to Section 7852 or (B) is or becomes the owner of another vessel permitted to operate in the Dungeness crab fishery pursuant to this section.(c) The department may require affidavits offered under penalty of perjury from persons applying for permits under subdivision (b) or from witnesses corroborating the statements of a person applying for a Dungeness crab vessel permit. Affidavits offered under penalty of perjury shall be required of an applicant if the department
				  cannot locate records required to qualify under subdivision (b).(d) No person shall be issued a Dungeness crab vessel permit under this section for any vessel unless that person has a valid commercial fishing license issued pursuant to Section 7852 that has not been suspended or revoked.(e) Notwithstanding Section 7852.2 or subdivision (e) of Section 8280.2, the department may issue a Dungeness crab vessel permit that has not been applied for by the application deadline if the department finds that the failure to apply was a result of a mistake or hardship, as established by evidence the department may require, the late application is made not later than October 15, 1995, and payment is made by the applicant of a late fee of two hundred fifty dollars ($250) in addition to all other fees for the permit.(f) The
				  department may waive the requirement that a person own a commercial fishing vessel that has been registered with the department pursuant to Section 7881 in each of the 1991–92, 1992–93, and 1993–94 permit years for one of those required years under this section only if the vessel was registered and used in the California Dungeness crab fishery during the registration year immediately prior to the year for which the waiver is sought and was registered and used in the California Dungeness crab fishery after the year for which the waiver is sought and if the reason for the failure to register in the year for which the waiver is sought was due to a death, illness, or injury, or other hardship, as determined by the review panel, that prevented the vessel from being registered and operated in the fishery for that registration year.(g) If any person submits false information for the purposes of obtaining a Dungeness crab vessel permit under this
				  section, the department shall revoke that permit, if issued, revoke the person’s commercial fishing license that was issued pursuant to Section 7850 for a period of not less than five years, and revoke the commercial boat registration for a period of not less than five years of any vessel registered to that person pursuant to Section 7881 of which that person is the owner.(h) This section shall become inoperative on April 1, 2012, and, as of January 1, 2013, is repealed, unless a later enacted statute that is enacted before January 1, 2013, deletes or extends the dates on which it becomes inoperative and is repealed.SEC. 21. Section 8280.2 of the Fish and Game Code is amended to read:8280.2. (a) The owner of a Dungeness crab vessel, for purposes of this section, may include a person with a bona fide contract for the purchase of a vessel who otherwise meets all other qualifications for a Dungeness crab vessel permit. If a contract is found to be fraudulent or written or entered into for the purposes of circumventing qualification criteria for the issuance of a permit, the applicant shall be permanently ineligible for a Dungeness crab vessel permit.(b) A Dungeness crab vessel permit shall be issued only to the person owning the vessel at the time of application for that permit. No person shall be issued more than one permit for each vessel owned by that person and qualifying for a permit pursuant to Section
				  8280.1.(c) A Dungeness crab vessel permit shall be issued only to the owner of a vessel taking crab by traps. No permit shall be issued to the owner of a vessel using trawl or other nets unless the owner of that vessel qualifies for a permit pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of Section 8280.1. No trawl or other net vessel authorized under this code to take Dungeness crab incidental to the taking of fish in trawl or other nets shall be required to possess a Dungeness crab vessel permit.(d) Dungeness crab vessel permits shall not be combined or otherwise aggregated for the purpose of replacing smaller vessels in the fishery with a larger vessel, and a permit shall not be divided or otherwise separated for the purpose of replacing a vessel in the fishery with two or more smaller vessels.(e) Applications
				  for renewal of all Dungeness crab vessel permits shall be received by the department, or, if mailed, postmarked, by April 30 of each year. In order for a vessel to retain eligibility, a permit shall be obtained each year subsequent to the initial permit year and the vessel shall be registered pursuant to Section 7881. The vessel owner shall have a valid commercial fishing license issued to that person pursuant to Section 7852 that has not been suspended or revoked. No minimum landings of Dungeness crab shall be required annually to be eligible for a Dungeness crab vessel permit.(f) This section shall become inoperative on April 1, 2012, and, as of January 1, 2013, is repealed, unless a later enacted statute that is enacted before January 1, 2013, deletes or extends the dates on which it becomes inoperative and is repealed.SEC. 22. Section 8280.3 of the Fish and Game Code is amended to read:8280.3. (a) Notwithstanding Article 9 (commencing with Section 8100) of Chapter 1 and except as provided in this section, a Dungeness crab vessel permit shall not be transferred.(1) The owner of a vessel to whom a Dungeness crab vessel permit has been issued shall transfer the permit for the use of that vessel upon the sale of the vessel by the permitholder to the person purchasing the vessel. Thereafter, upon notice to the department, the person purchasing the vessel may use the vessel for the taking and landing of Dungeness crab for any and all of the unexpired portion of the permit year, and that person is eligible for a permit pursuant to Section 8280.1 for the use of that vessel in subsequent years. The person purchasing the
				  vessel may not transfer the permit for use of that vessel in the Dungeness crab fishery to another replacement vessel during the same permit year.(2) The owner of a vessel to whom the Dungeness crab vessel permit has been issued may transfer the permit to a replacement vessel of equivalent capacity, except as specified in this section. Thereafter, upon notice to the department and payment of the transfer fee specified in Section 8280.6, the replacement vessel may be used for the taking and landing of Dungeness crab for any and all of the unexpired portion of the permit year and that person is eligible for a permit pursuant to Section 8280.1 for the use of that replacement vessel in subsequent years.The owner of a permitted vessel may transfer the permit to a vessel of greater capacity that was owned by that person on or before November 15, 1995, not to exceed 10 feet longer in length overall than the
				  vessel for which the permit was originally issued or to a vessel of greater capacity purchased after November 15, 1995, not to exceed five feet longer in length overall than the vessel for which the permit was originally issued.The department, upon recommendation of the Dungeness crab review panel, may authorize the owner of a permitted vessel to transfer the permit to a replacement vessel that was owned by that person on or before April 1, 1996, that does not fish with trawl nets that is greater than five feet longer in length overall than the vessel for which the permit was originally issued, if all of the following conditions are satisfied:(A) A vessel of a larger size is essential to the owner for participation in another fishery other than a trawl net fishery.(B) The owner held a permit on or before January 1, 1995, for the
				  fishery for which a larger vessel is needed and has participated in that fishery.(C) The permit for the vessel from which the permit is to be transferred qualified pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of Section 8280.1.(D) The vessel to which the permit is to be transferred does not exceed 20 feet longer in length overall than the vessel for which the permit was originally issued and the vessel to which the permit is to be transferred does not exceed 60 feet in overall length.No transfer of a permit to a larger vessel shall be allowed more than one time. If a permit is transferred to a larger vessel, any Dungeness crab vessel permit for that permit year or any subsequent permit years for that larger vessel may not be transferred to another larger vessel. The department shall not thereafter issue a Dungeness crab vessel permit
				  for the use of the original vessel from which the permit was transferred, except that the original vessel may be used to take or land Dungeness crab after that transfer if its use is authorized pursuant to another Dungeness crab vessel permit subsequently transferred to that vessel pursuant to this paragraph.(3) Upon the written approval of the department, the owner of a vessel to whom the Dungeness crab vessel permit has been issued may temporarily transfer the permit to another replacement vessel, for which use in the Dungeness crab fishery is not permitted pursuant to this section or Section 8280.1, for a period of not more than six months during the current permit year if the vessel for which the permit was issued is seriously damaged, suffers major mechanical breakdown, or is lost or destroyed, as determined by the department, upon approval of the director. The owner of the vessel shall submit proof that the department may reasonably
				  require to establish the existence of the conditions of this paragraph. Upon approval by the director, the owner of a lost or destroyed vessel granted a six-month temporary transfer under this section may be granted an additional six-month extension of the temporary transfer.(4) Upon written approval of the department, the owner of a vessel to whom the Dungeness crab vessel permit has been issued may retain that permit upon the sale of that permitted vessel for the purpose of transferring the permit to another vessel to be purchased by that individual within one year of the time of sale of the vessel for which the permit was originally issued if the requirements of this section are satisfied, including the payment of transfer fees. If the permit is not transferred to a new vessel owned by the person to whom the vessel permit was originally issued within one year of the sale of the vessel for which it was originally issued, or if the person
				  does not retain ownership of the new vessel to which the permit is transferred for a period of not less than one year, the permit shall be revoked.(5) In the event of the death or incapacity of a permitholder, the permit shall be transferred, upon application, to the heirs or assigns, or to the working partner, of the permitholder, together with the transfer of the vessel for which the permit was issued, and the new owner may continue to operate the vessel under the permit, renew the permit, or transfer the permit upon sale of the vessel pursuant to paragraph (1).(b) This section shall become inoperative on April 1, 2012, and, as of January 1, 2013, is repealed, unless a later enacted statute that is enacted before January 1, 2013, deletes or extends the dates on which it becomes inoperative and is repealed.SEC. 23. Section 8280.4 of the Fish and Game Code is amended to read:8280.4. (a) The commission may revoke the commercial fishing license issued pursuant to Section 7852 of any person owning a fishing vessel engaging in the taking or landing of Dungeness crab by traps for which that person has not obtained a Dungeness crab vessel permit, and the commission may revoke the registration, issued pursuant to Section 7881, for that vessel.(b) This section shall become inoperative on April 1, 2012, and, as of January 1, 2013, is repealed, unless a later enacted statute that is enacted before January 1, 2013, deletes or extends the dates on which it becomes inoperative and is repealed.SEC. 24. Section 8280.5 of the Fish and Game Code is amended to read:8280.5. (a) The director shall convene a Dungeness crab review panel for the purpose of reviewing applications for Dungeness crab vessel permits pursuant to paragraphs (2) and (4) of subdivision (b) of Section 8280.1 and applications for permit transfers pursuant to Section 8280.3 if the department determines that the additional review and advice of the panel will be helpful in deciding whether to issue a permit or approve a transfer.(b) The panel shall consist of one nonvoting representative of the department and three public voting members selected by the director to represent the Dungeness crab fishing industry. One public member shall be licensed pursuant to Article 7 (commencing with Section 8030) of Chapter 1 and active in
				  Dungeness crab processing in this state. Two public members shall be licensed pursuant to Section 7852, one from Sonoma County or a county south of Sonoma County, and one from Mendocino County or a county north of Mendocino County, and active in the taking and landing of Dungeness crab in this state.
