                                NO  Bill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:(a) The Santa Susana Field Laboratory property in Ventura County can play an important role in aiding the preservation of critical habitat and wildlife corridors, as well as historical artifacts of regional, statewide, and national importance. Remarkably preserved Native American cave paintings exist at this site and should be safeguarded for future generations.(b) The property played a crucial role in the development of our country’s space and nuclear programs. Equipment used to develop that technology still exists at the site and should be preserved as educational monuments for future generations.(c) Testing done at the site had the great misfortune of contaminating the ground, causing the property to become a source of regional controversy. The enactment of Chapter 729 of the Statutes of 2007 guarantees that the property will be cleaned to the highest standards. With the issue of cleanup of the property codified in state law, it is important to establish a vision for the property once the cleanup is complete.(d) The site offers a rare opportunity to create a diverse park that incorporates wildlife and habitat protection, recreational opportunities, as well as the education of visitors on both the historical significance of the site and the importance of applying appropriate land use protocols in order to avoid contamination of sensitive ecosystems in the future.(e) The Department of Parks and Recreation is
		  the appropriate state agency to lead the development of the creation of this property as a new state park.(f) In creating a new state park in the Ventura and Los Angeles region, it is important that the Department of Parks and Recreation work with local groups and allow them to play an advisory role to guarantee that the region has a voice during the creation of the park.SEC. 2. (a) It is the intent of the Legislature to provide park and recreational opportunities for the Ventura and Los Angeles region and the state by designating the Department of Parks and Recreation to develop into a state park the property known as the “Santa Susana Field Laboratory” in Ventura County.(b) It is further the intent of the Legislature that local, state, and federal agencies, environmental, recreational, historic preservation, and cultural organizations, museums, educational institutions and organizations, labor groups, private persons and entities, and community-based organizations, including the groups instrumental in community advocacy that led to current plans for development of the Santa Susana Field
		  Laboratory site as a state park, have the opportunity to participate in project planning and development.SEC. 3. Section 5006.43 is added to the Public Resources Code, to read:5006.43. (a) On or before January 1, 2012, the director shall establish the Santa Susana State Park Advisory Committee, which shall be responsible for assisting the department, in an advisory capacity, to plan for interim and permanent land uses and facilities through the general planning process for the Santa Susana Field Laboratory (SSFL) site. The director shall terminate the advisory committee after the adoption of a general plan for the state park.(b) The director shall convene and appoint the advisory committee. The members of the advisory committee shall be selected by the director, and shall include representatives from entities, including, but not limited to, local, state, and federal agencies, environmental, recreational, historic
				  preservation, and cultural organizations, museums, educational institutions and organizations, labor groups, individuals and private sector entities, and community-based organizations, including African American, Asian Pacific American, Chinese American, and Latino community organizations, and other interested ethnic groups.(c) The department shall take all of the following actions with respect to the development of a state park at the SSFL site:(1) Coordinate the implementation of the SSFL project, considering recommendations for uses and development from the advisory committee.(2) Survey statewide and community preferences in a range of park services appropriate for the setting of the SSFL site, as assisted by the advisory committee.(3) Seek input
				  from and cooperate with local, state, and federal agencies, environmental, recreational, historic preservation, and cultural organizations, museums, educational institutions and organizations, labor groups, individuals and private sector entities, and community-based organizations, as appropriate, that are interested in the use or development of park and recreational facilities and programs for the public benefit at the state park proposed to be located at the SSFL site, including the special needs of children, youths, senior citizens, and persons with disabilities.(d) The advisory committee shall identify and recommend to the director priorities for long-range plans for the SSFL site that meet the needs of Californians and the general public, including park and recreational facilities and programs serving residents within communities surrounding the SSFL site in Ventura County.SEC. 4. (a) The Santa Susana Field Laboratory (SSFL) property shall not be transferred to the state and a park shall not be opened at the SSFL site until the site has been cleaned pursuant to Article 5.5 (commencing with Section 25359.20) of Chapter 6.8 of Division 20 of the Health and Safety Code.(b) This act shall not make the state liable for cleanup of any contamination that may be found to be present at the SSFL site.
