											  Taxation: property tax postponement.The Senior Citizens and Disabled Citizens Property Tax Postponement Law, until February 20, 2009, authorized a claimant, as defined, to file with the Controller a claim to postpone the payment of ad valorem property taxes, where household income, as defined, did not exceed specified amounts. Existing law authorized the Controller, upon approval of the claim, to either make payments directly to specified entities, or to issue the claimant a certificate of eligibility that constituted a written promise of the state to pay the amount specified on the claim, as provided. That law required these payments to be made out of amounts appropriated by the Controller, as specified.This bill would revise and recast the provisions of the Senior Citizens and Disabled Citizens Property Tax Postponement Law to, among other things, delete the Controller’s authority,
		either to either make payments directly to specified entities or to issue the claimant a certificate of eligibility, and would instead require the Controller to issue a property tax postponement payment on behalf of the claimant upon receipt of a specified verification from the county tax collector. This bill would authorize the Controller, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to use moneys in the Senior Citizens and Disabled Citizens Property Tax Postponement Fund, which this bill would create, to make property tax postponement payments. This bill would require all sums paid by the Controller to be secured by a lien of first priority, which has priority over all other subsequently filed liens. This bill would
		require the Controller to prescribe a maximum annual postponement loan amount, and would change the rate of interest for any deferrals made on or after January 1, 2010, as provided. ThisThis bill would also make conforming changes to related provisions The Senior Citizens Mobilehome Property Tax Postponement Law and The Senior Citizens Possessory Interest Holder Property Tax Postponement Law.Existing law, on and after February 20, 2009, prohibits a person from filing a
		claim for postponement, and prohibits the Controller from accepting applications for postponement, under the Senior Citizens and Disabled Citizens Property Tax Postponement Law.This bill would repeal that provision.This bill would, for the 2009–10 and 2010–11 fiscal years, authorize the tax collector to cancel any delinquent penalties and interest owed by the claimant for those fiscal years if a postponement claim is filed timely, as specified.The Senior Citizens Tenant-Stockholder Property Tax Postponement Law authorizes a tenant-stockholder claimant, as defined, to file with the Controller a claim to postpone the payment of ad valorem property taxes, as provided.This bill would repeal that law and make conforming changes to related provisions. This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.Digest Key

(b) Suspension of the Senior Citizens and Disabled Citizens Property Tax Postponement Law in
		  February 2009 has exposed participants to possible default on property taxes in December 2009 and thereafter, and has heightened fears of home foreclosures. (c) While counties may not force the sale of a home to collect on delinquent property taxes for five years, no similar delay applies to lenders that would protect the elderly and disabled who would have participated in the property tax deferral program established pursuant to the Senior Citizens and Disabled Citizens Property Tax Postponement Law had it not been suspended. SEC. 2. Section 2923.57 is added to the Civil Code, to read:2923.57. (a) This section shall apply only to a default on a mortgage or deed of trust for the failure to pay property taxes.

(c) If, within the 90-day period described in subdivision (a), the mortgagee, trustee, or other person authorized to take sale is informed that the trustor or mortgagor was participating in the property tax deferral program on or before February 19, 2009, and the trustor or mortgagor provides a copy of the certificate of eligibility issued by the Controller, as evidences of this participation, the mortgagee, trustee, or other person authorized to take sale shall not file a notice of default based on the failure to pay property taxes for five years from the date of first contacting the mortgagor or trustor.
