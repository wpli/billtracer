											  Supplemental instruction. Workplace learning.Existing law prohibits a high school or unified school district from reporting for state apportionments average daily attendance in classes that are not located in facilities clearly identified in a manner and established by appropriate procedures to ensure that attendance in the class is open to the general public, except as specified.This bill would allow a school district to report for state apportionments average daily attendance in classes that are not open to the general public if the classes are held in the workplace, are intended primarily to help pupils with attainment of a General Education Development (GED) credential or high school diploma, and are offered by an employee of the district appropriately credentialed for the course being offered. This bill would also authorize the State Board of Education to adopt regulations necessary
		to enforce these provisions.Existing law authorizes the governing board of a community college district to establish and maintain classes for adults also open to any minors who, in the judgment of the governing board, may be qualified for admission thereto.This bill would provide, however, that when a class is held in the workplace and is intended to assist pupils with attaining a GED credential or high school diploma, admission to the class may be limited to employees at the worksite.Existing law requires the governing board of each school district maintaining any or all of grades 2 to 9, inclusive, to offer, and authorizes a charter school to offer, programs of direct, systematic, and intensive supplemental instruction to pupils enrolled in grades 2 to 9, inclusive, who have been recommended for retention or who have been retained, and authorizes a school district or charter school to require a pupil who has been retained to participate in supplemental instructional programs. Existing law authorizes the Long Beach Unified School District or any other school district to require pupils, who are identified pursuant to a policy adopted by the governing board of the school district at a regularly scheduled board meeting, to participate in those supplemental instructional programs. This bill would make a technical, nonsubstantive change to these provisions.Digest Key
