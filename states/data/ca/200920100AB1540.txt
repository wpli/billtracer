						LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1540, Committee on Health.
										Health.(1) Existing law, the California Public Records Act, requires certain public records to be made available for public inspection. Existing law, the Health Data and Advisory Council Consolidation Act, requires every organization that operates, conducts, or maintains a health facility to make and file with the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, specified reports containing various financial and patient data. Existing law requires the office to publish risk-adjusted outcome reports for coronary artery bypass graft surgeries, as specified.This bill would provide, with respect to the above provisions, that patient medical record numbers and any other data elements that the office believes could be used to determine the identity of an individual patient shall be exempt from the disclosure requirements of the California Public Records Act.(2) Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care. Existing law provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. The Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975 authorizes the director of the department to adopt, amend, and rescind any rules necessary to carry out the act and requires health care service plans to provide certain notices. This bill would authorize the director to, by regulation, modify the wording of any notice required by the act for purposes of clarity, readability, and accuracy.The bill would make other technical, nonsubstantive changes to related provisions governing health care service plans.(3) Existing law, known as the California Safe Drinking Water Act, requires the State Department of Public Health to administer provisions relating to the regulation of drinking water to protect public health.Existing law requires the department to adopt regulations it determines to be necessary to carry out the purposes of the California Safe Drinking Water Act. Existing law requires regulations adopted by the department to include requirements governing the use of point-of-entry treatment by public water systems in lieu of centralized treatment, as specified.This bill would require regulations adopted by the department to include requirements governing the use of point-of-entry and point-of-use treatment by public water systems in lieu of centralized treatment, as specified. The bill would also prohibit the department from issuing or amending a permit to allow the use of point-of-use treatment unless the department determines, after a public hearing, that there is no substantial community opposition. It would also limit the issuance of that permit to the lesser of 3 years or until funding for centralized treatment is
		available.(4) Under existing law, when a primary drinking water standard is not complied with, when a monitoring requirement is not performed, or when a water purveyor fails to comply with the conditions of a variance or exception, a public water system is required to notify the department and users, as specified.This bill would, if user notification is required pursuant to this provision, require the department to make a reasonable effort to ensure that notification is given. (5) Existing law provides that the department may issue a citation to a public water system that violates the California Safe Drinking Water Act. Existing law provides that for noncontinuing violations of primary drinking standards, other than turbidity, the department may assess a civil penalty in the citation, as specified.This bill would delete the exemption for turbidity.This bill would make other technical, nonsubstantive changes to related provisions governing the issuance of citations for violations of the California Safe Drinking Water Act.(6) Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services and under which qualified low-income persons receive health care benefits. Existing law requires that health care providers apply to, and be certified by, the department prior to their participation in the Medi-Cal program.Existing law allows the department to grant provisional provider status or preferred provisional provider status to an applicant or provider, and requires the department to terminate that status if any specified grounds exist.This bill would correct obsolete references in the above provisions.(7) Under existing law, the Medi‑Cal program is partially governed and funded as part of the federal Medicaid Program. Existing law requires the department to amend the Medicaid state plan with respect to the billing option for services by local educational agencies to ensure that schools are reimbursed for all eligible services that they provide that are not precluded by federal requirements. Existing law would repeal these provisions on January 1, 2010.This bill would change the repeal date to January 1, 2013.(8) Existing law establishes the Local Education Agency Medi‑Cal Recovery Account in the Special Deposit Fund, to be used only to support the department in meeting the requirements of the above provisions, and specifies a formula for funding and staffing activities provided for under these provisions.Existing law provides that as of January 1, 2010, unless the Legislature enacts a new statute or extends the date beyond January 1, 2010, all funds in the Local Education Agency Medi‑Cal Recovery Account shall be returned proportionately to all local education agencies whose federal Medicaid funds were used to create the account.This bill would rename the account the Local Educational Agency Medi‑Cal Recovery Fund.This bill would also provide that, as of January 1, 2013, unless the Legislature enacts a new statute or extends the repeal date, all funds in the Local Educational Agency Medi-Cal Recovery Fund shall be returned proportionally to all local educational agencies whose federal Medicaid funds were used to create the fund.(9) Existing law, until January 1, 2011, requests the University of California to establish the California Health Benefit Review Program to assess legislation proposing a mandated health benefit or service, as defined, to be provided by health care service plans and health insurers, and to prepare a written analysis in accordance with specified criteria.This bill would extend the repeal date of the above provisions to June 30, 2015.(10) Existing law requests the University of California to submit a report to the Governor and the Legislature no later than January 1, 2010, regarding the implementation of the above provisions.This bill would, instead, request the University of California to submit a report no later than January 1, 2014.(11) Existing law, for fiscal years 2006–07 to 2009–10, inclusive, provides funding for the University of California’s implementation of the above provisions from a fee imposed upon health care service plans and health insurers, which would not exceed a total of $2,000,000, and is to be deposited in the Health Care Benefits Fund.This bill, instead, provides for the imposition of that fee for fiscal years 2010–11 to 2014–15, inclusive.(12) Existing law requires the State Department of Public Health to maintain a program for the control of tuberculosis. Existing law, until January 1, 2011, requires a local health department that elects to participate in the program to provide for
		certification for one year, by the local health officer, of tuberculin skin test technicians.This bill would delete the repeal date of these provisions, thereby extending the operation of these provisions indefinitely.(13) This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 6276.24 of the Government Code proposed by SB 359, that would become operative only if SB 359 and this bill are both chaptered and become effective on or before January 1, 2010, and this bill is chaptered last. The bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 14043.28 of the Welfare and Institutions Code proposed by AB 839, that would become operative only if AB 839 and this bill are both chaptered and become effective on or before January 1, 2010, and this bill is chaptered last.Digest Key

				  following basic services: medical, nursing, surgical, anesthesia, laboratory, radiology, pharmacy, and dietary services.

A general acute care hospital that exclusively provides acute medical rehabilitation center services, including at least physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy, may provide for the required surgical and anesthesia services through a contract with another acute care hospital. In addition, a general acute care hospital that, on July 1, 1983, provided required surgical and anesthesia services through a contract or agreement with another acute care hospital may continue to provide these surgical and anesthesia services through a contract or agreement with an acute care hospital. The general acute care hospital operated by the State Department of Developmental Services at Agnews Developmental Center may, until June 30, 2007,
				  provide surgery and anesthesia services through a contract or agreement with another acute care hospital. Notwithstanding the requirements of this subdivision, a general acute care hospital operated by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation or the Department of Veterans Affairs may provide surgery and anesthesia services during normal weekday working hours, and not provide these services during other hours of the weekday or on weekends or holidays, if the general acute care hospital otherwise meets the requirements of this section.A “general acute care hospital” includes a “rural general acute care hospital.” However, a “rural general acute care hospital” shall not be required by the department to provide surgery and anesthesia services. A “rural general acute care hospital” shall meet either of the following conditions:(1) The hospital meets criteria for designation within peer group six

				  specified in paragraph (2). The primary need of congregate living health facility residents shall be for availability of skilled nursing care on a recurring, intermittent, extended, or continuous basis. This care is generally less intense than that provided in general acute care hospitals but more intense than that provided in skilled nursing facilities.(2) Congregate living health facilities shall provide one of the following services:(A) Services for persons who are mentally alert, persons with physical disabilities, who may be ventilator dependent.(B) Services for persons who have a diagnosis of terminal illness, a diagnosis of a life-threatening illness, or both.

This definition shall not apply to those areas of a law enforcement facility that houses inmates or wards that may be receiving outpatient services and are housed separately for reasons of improved access to health care, security, and
				  protection. The health services provided by a correctional treatment center shall include, but are not limited to, all of the following basic services: physician and surgeon, psychiatrist, psychologist, nursing, pharmacy, and dietary.

				  have been certified by a physician and surgeon as warranting continuous skilled nursing care. The facility shall serve medically fragile persons who have developmental disabilities or demonstrate significant developmental delay that may lead to a developmental disability if not treated. ICF/DD-CN facilities shall be subject to licensure under this chapter upon adoption of licensing regulations in accordance with Section 1275.3. A facility providing continuous skilled nursing services to persons with developmental disabilities pursuant to Section 14132.20 or 14495.10 of the Welfare and Institutions Code shall apply for licensure under this subdivision within 90 days after the regulations become effective, and may continue to operate pursuant to those sections until its licensure application is either approved or denied.SEC. 3. Section 1344 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:1344. (a) The director may from time to time adopt, amend, and rescind any rules, forms, and orders that are necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter, including rules governing applications and reports, and defining any terms, whether or not used in this chapter, insofar as the definitions are not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter. For the purpose of rules and forms, the director may classify persons and matters within the director’s jurisdiction, and may prescribe different requirements for different classes. The director may waive any requirement of any rule or form in situations where in the director’s discretion that requirement is not necessary in the public interest or for the protection of the public, subscribers,
				  enrollees, or persons or plans subject to this chapter. The director may adopt rules consistent with federal regulations and statutes to regulate health care coverage supplementing Medicare.(b) The director may, by regulation, modify the wording of any notice required by this chapter for purposes of clarity, readability, and accuracy, except that a modification shall not change the substantive meaning of the notice.(c) The director may honor requests from interested parties for interpretive opinions.(d) No provision of this chapter imposing any liability applies to any act done or omitted in good faith in conformity with any rule, form, order, or written interpretive opinion of the director, or any opinion of the Attorney General, notwithstanding that the rule, form, order, or written interpretive opinion may

Direct billing pursuant to this subdivision is permitted only to the extent that the same services are not billed for by the medical group, physician, or independent practice association.(c) A health care service plan may require the nonphysician provider to complete an appropriate credentialing process.(d) Every health care service plan may either list licensed nonphysician providers that contract with medical groups, physicians, and independent practice associations pursuant to subdivision (b) in any listing or directory of plan health care providers that is provided to enrollees or to the public, or may include a notification in the plan’s evidence of coverage or provider list that the health care service plan has contracts with nonphysician providers, pursuant to subdivision (b), and may list the types of contracted
				  nonphysician providers. The notification may inform an enrollee that he or she may obtain a list of the nonphysician providers by contacting his or her primary or specialist medical group. The listing may indicate whether licensed nonphysician providers may be accessed directly by enrollees.(e) Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize, or otherwise require the director to approve, a risk-sharing arrangement between a plan and a provider.SEC. 5. Section 1374.64 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:1374.64. (a) Only a plan that has been licensed under this chapter and in operation in this state for a period of five years or more, or a plan licensed under this chapter and operating in this state for a period of five or more years under a combination of (1) licensure under this chapter and (2) pursuant to a certificate of authority issued by the Department of Insurance may offer a point-of-service contract. A specialized health care service plan shall not offer a point-of-service plan contract unless this plan was formerly registered under the Knox-Mills Health Plan Act (Article 2.5 (commencing with Section 12530) of Chapter 6 of Part 2 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code), as repealed by Chapter 941 of the Statutes of 1975, and offered

This insurance shall obligate the insurer to continue to provide care for the period in which a premium was paid in the event a plan becomes insolvent. Where a plan cannot obtain insurance as required by this subparagraph, then a plan may demonstrate to the director that it has made other arrangements,
				  acceptable to the director, for the cost of providing enrollees out-of-network health care services; but in this case the expenditure for total out-of-network costs for all enrollees in all point-of-service contracts shall be limited to a percentage, acceptable to the director, not to exceed 15 percent of total health care expenditures for all its enrollees.(c) Within 30 days of the close of each month a plan offering point-of-service plan contracts under paragraph (2) of subdivision (b) shall file with the director a monthly financial report consisting of a balance sheet and statement of operations of the plan, which need not be certified, and a calculation of the adjusted tangible net equity required under subparagraph (A).

A plan shall also make
				  special reports to the director as the director may from time to time require. Each report to be filed by a plan pursuant to this subdivision shall be verified by a principal officer of the plan as set forth in Section 1300.84.2(e) of Title 28 of the California Code of Regulations.(d) If it appears to the director that a plan does not have sufficient financial viability, or organizational and administrative capacity to ensure the delivery of health care services to its enrollees, the director may, by written order, direct the plan to discontinue the offering of a point-of-service plan contract. The order shall be effective immediately.SEC. 6. Section 1375.4 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:1375.4. (a) Every contract between a health care service plan and a risk-bearing organization that is issued, amended, renewed, or delivered in this state on or after July 1, 2000, shall include provisions concerning the following, as to the risk-bearing organization’s administrative and financial capacity, which shall be effective as of January 1, 2001:(1) A requirement that the risk-bearing organization furnish financial information to the health care service plan or the plan’s designated agent and meet any other financial requirements that assist the health care service plan in maintaining the financial viability of its arrangements for the provision of health care services in a manner
				  that does not adversely affect the integrity of the contract negotiation process.(2) A requirement that the health care service plan disclose information to the risk-bearing organization that enables the risk-bearing organization to be informed regarding the financial risk assumed under the contract.(3) A requirement that the health care service plans provide payments of all risk arrangements, excluding capitation, within 180 days after close of the fiscal year.(b) In accordance with subdivision (a) of Section 1344, the director shall adopt regulations on or before June 30, 2000, to implement this section which shall, at a minimum, provide for the following:(1) (A)  A process for reviewing or grading risk-bearing organizations

				  a positive tangible net equity, as defined in subdivision (e) of Section 1300.76 of Title 28 of the California Code of Regulations.(iv)  The risk-bearing organization meets criterion 4 if it maintains at all times a positive level of working capital (excess of current assets over current liabilities).(B) A risk-bearing organization may reduce its liabilities for purposes of calculating tangible net equity, pursuant to clause (iii) of subparagraph (A), and working capital, pursuant to clause (iv) of subparagraph (A), by the amount of any liabilities the payment of which is guaranteed by a sponsoring organization pursuant to a qualified guarantee.

				  deficiencies that need to be corrected by the risk-bearing organization, and contingency plans to ensure the delivery of health care services if the corrective action fails. The corrective action plan shall be approved by the director and standardized, to the extent possible, to meet the needs of the director and all health care service plans contracting with the risk-bearing organization. If the health care service plan and the risk-bearing organization are unable to determine a mutually agreeable corrective action plan, the director shall determine the corrective action plan.(5) The disclosure of information by health care service plans to the risk-bearing organization that enables the risk-bearing organization to be informed regarding the risk assumed under the contract, including:(A) Enrollee information monthly.(B) Risk arrangement information, information pertaining to any pharmacy risk assumed under the contract, information regarding incentive payments, and information on income and expenses assigned to the risk-bearing organization quarterly.(6) Periodic reports from each health care service plan to the director that include information concerning the risk-bearing organizations and the type and amount of financial risk assumed by them, and, if deemed necessary and appropriate by the director, a registration process for the risk-bearing organizations.(7) The confidentiality of financial and other records to be produced, disclosed, or otherwise made available, unless as otherwise determined by the director.(c) The failure by a health care service plan to comply with the contractual requirements pursuant to
				  this section shall constitute grounds for disciplinary action. The director shall, as appropriate, within 60 days after receipt of documented violation from a risk-bearing organization, investigate and take enforcement action against a health care service plan that fails to comply with these requirements and shall periodically evaluate contracts between health care service plans and risk-bearing organizations to determine if any audit, evaluation, or enforcement actions should be undertaken by the department.(d) The Financial Solvency Standards Board established in Section 1347.15 shall study and report to the director on or before January 1, 2001, regarding all of the following:(1) The feasibility of requiring that there be in force insurance coverage commensurate with the financial risk assumed by the risk-bearing organization to protect against financial losses.(2) The appropriateness of different risk-bearing arrangements between health care service plans and risk-bearing organizations.(3) The appropriateness of the four criteria specified in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b).(e) This section shall not apply to specialized health care service plans.(f) For purposes of this section, “provider organization” means a medical group, independent practice association, or other entity that delivers, furnishes, or otherwise arranges for or provides health care services, but does not include an individual or a plan.(g) (1) For purposes of this section, a “risk-bearing organization” means a professional medical corporation, other form
				  of corporation controlled by physicians and surgeons, a medical partnership, a medical foundation exempt from licensure pursuant to subdivision (l) of Section 1206, or another lawfully organized group of physicians that delivers, furnishes, or otherwise arranges for or provides health care services, but does not include an individual or a health care service plan, and that does all of the following:(A) Contracts directly with a health care service plan or arranges for health care services for the health care service plan’s enrollees.(B) Receives compensation for those services on any capitated or fixed periodic payment basis.(C) Is responsible for the processing and payment of claims made by providers for services rendered by those providers on behalf of a health care service plan that are covered under the
				  capitation or fixed periodic payment made by the plan to the risk-bearing organization. Nothing in this subparagraph in any way limits, alters, or abrogates any responsibility of a health care service plan under existing law.(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), risk-bearing organizations shall not be deemed to include a provider organization that meets either of the following requirements:(A) The health care service plan files with the department consolidated financial statements that include the provider organization.(B) The health care service plan is the only health care service plan with which the provider organization contracts for arranging or providing health care services and, during the previous and current fiscal years, the provider organization’s maximum potential expenses for providing or arranging for

				  to January 1, 1991, shall, upon that date, make a deposit of 50 percent of the amount required by subparagraph (A), and shall maintain additional cash or cash equivalents as defined by rule of the director, in the amount of 50 percent of the amount required by subparagraph (A), and shall make a deposit of 100 percent of the amount required by subparagraph (A) by January 1, 1992.(C) The amount of the deposit shall be reasonably estimated as of the first day of the month and maintained for the remainder of the month.(D) The deposit required by this paragraph is in addition to the deposit that may be required by rule of the director and is an allowable asset of the plan in the determination of tangible net equity as defined in subdivision (b) of Section 1300.76 of Title 28 of the California Code of Regulations. All income from the deposit shall be an asset of the plan and may be

				  health care services over the immediately preceding six months, the plan shall file a written report with the director containing the information necessary to determine compliance with subdivision (a) no later than 30 business days from the first day of the month. Upon an adequate showing by the plan that the requirements of this section should be waived or reduced, the director may waive or reduce these requirements to an amount as the director deems sufficient to protect subscribers and enrollees of the plan consistent with the intent and purpose of this chapter.(c) Every plan which reimburses providers of health care service on a fee-for-services basis; or which directly reimburses its subscribers or enrollees, to an extent exceeding 10 percent of its total payments for health care services, shall estimate and record in the books of account a liability for incurred and unreported claims. Upon a determination by the director that the
				  estimate is inadequate, the director may require the plan to increase its estimate of incurred and unreported claims. Every plan shall promptly report to the director whenever these reimbursables exceed 10 percent of its total expenditures for health care services.As used herein, the term “fee-for-services” refers to the situation where the amount of reimbursement paid by the plan to providers of service is determined by the amount and type of service rendered by the provider of service.(d) In the event an insolvent plan covered by this section fails to pay a noncontracting provider sums for covered services owed, the provider shall first look to the uncovered expenditures insolvency deposit or the insurance or guaranty arrangement maintained by the plan for payment. When a plan becomes insolvent, in no event shall a noncontracting provider, or agent, trustee, or assignee thereof, attempt to collect
				  from the subscriber or enrollee sums owed for covered services by the plan or maintain any action at law against a subscriber or enrollee to collect sums owed by the plan for covered services without having first attempted to obtain reimbursement from the plan.SEC. 9. Section 1399 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:1399. (a) Surrender of a license as a health plan becomes effective 30 days after receipt of an application to surrender the license or within a shorter period of time as the director may determine, unless a revocation or suspension proceeding is pending when the application is filed or a proceeding to revoke or suspend or to impose conditions upon the surrender is instituted within 30 days after the application is filed.
