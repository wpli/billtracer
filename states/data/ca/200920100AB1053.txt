						LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1053, Solorio.
											  Juveniles.(1) Existing law establishes the Interstate Compact on Juveniles. The compact sets forth the agreement between the contracting states regarding the supervision of delinquent juveniles, including the procedure for the return of runaways and escapees.This bill would repeal the Interstate Compact on Juveniles and instead enact, only until January 1, 2012, the Interstate Compact for Juveniles. This compact would make the state subject to rules and regulations having the force and effect of statutory law governing the supervision or return of juvenile offenders, including status offenders, in the compacting states as developed at a future date by the Interstate Commission for Juveniles, except when a provision exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the Legislature, or as specified. The commission consists of commissioners appointed as specified in each compacting state. Any state and any one of
		specified United States territories is eligible to become a compacting state. Each compacting state represented at any meeting of the commission is entitled to one vote. The compact would also require the state to create a State Council for Interstate Juvenile Supervision that would exercise related duties, as specified. The bill would authorize the commission to levy and collect an annual assessment from the state and the other compacting states to cover the cost of the internal operations and activities of the commission and its staff based upon a formula to be determined by the commission, that takes into consideration, among other things, the population of each compacting state. The bill would also authorize the commission to impose penalties on the state, including fines, fees, and costs, for default in the performance of the state’s obligations under the compact, as determined by the commission. The bill would provide that the compact administrator, as defined, in this state would be the executive
		director of the Corrections Standards Authority. The bill would require that executive director to convene an executive steering committee to review and make recommendations regarding the compact, as specified. The bill would also require the Corrections Standards Authority to present the committee’s final report to the Legislature by January 1, 2011.Because the compact took effect upon the later of July 1, 2004, or upon enactment into law by the 35th jurisdiction, as specified, and because the latter event has occurred, if this bill is enacted, the compact would be binding upon the state, except as specified.(2) Existing law requires the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Division of Juvenile Facilities, not less than 30 days prior to the scheduled parole consideration hearing of a ward eligible for release on parole on or after September 1, 2007, as specified, to notify the ward of the date and location of the parole consideration hearing. Existing law provides that the ward has the right to contact his or her parent or guardian to inform the parent or guardian of the date and location of the parole consideration hearing, and to inform
		other persons identified by the ward who are considered by the division as likely to contribute to a ward’s preparation for the parole consideration hearing or the ward’s postrelease success. An appropriate staff person is required, on specified occasions, to explain these rights to the ward. The committing court is required, within 15 court days of the release by the division of the ward, to convene a reentry disposition hearing for the ward to identify those conditions of probation that are appropriate under all the circumstances of the case, including incorporating a reentry plan. The county of commitment is required to supervise the reentry of those wards. However, none of these provisions apply to a ward who was committed to the custody of the division for specified offenses, including murder, kidnapping, and certain sex offenses.This bill would require the division to place all applicable wards, as defined, in its custody on supervised parole within the
		period of 120 to 90 days prior to the date of release from custody, as specified, or within the period of 120 to 90 days prior to completion of the maximum period of confinement, as specified, whichever comes first. This bill would provide that these provisions do not apply when a petition or order for further detention has been requested, as provided. This bill would also provide that a ward who has been released under these provisions shall be subject to revocation of parole for alleged violations committed during the release period.Digest Key

								CHAPTER
							 4. The Interstate Compact for Juveniles1400. THE INTERSTATE COMPACT FOR JUVENILES ARTICLE IPURPOSE The compacting states to this Interstate Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the proper supervision or return of juveniles, delinquents, and status offenders who are on probation or parole and who have absconded, escaped, or run away from supervision and control and in so doing have endangered their own safety and the safety of others. The compacting states also recognize that each state is responsible for the safe return of juveniles who have run away from home and in
					 doing so have left their state of residence. The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act (4 U.S.C. Sec. 112), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.It is the purpose of this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states to: (a) ensure that the adjudicated juveniles and status offenders subject to this compact are provided adequate supervision and services in the receiving state as ordered by the adjudicating judge or parole authority in the sending state; (b) ensure that the public safety interests of the citizens, including the victims of juvenile offenders, in both the sending and receiving states are adequately protected; (c) return juveniles who have run away, absconded, or escaped from supervision or control or have been accused of an offense to the state requesting their return; (d) make contracts for the
					 cooperative institutionalization in public facilities in member states for delinquent youth needing special services; (e) provide for the effective tracking and supervision of juveniles; (f) equitably allocate the costs, benefits, and obligations of the compacting states; (g) establish procedures to manage the movement between states of juvenile offenders released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, juvenile departments, or any other criminal or juvenile justice agency which has jurisdiction over juvenile offenders; (h) insure immediate notice to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; (i) establish procedures to resolve pending charges (detainers) against juvenile offenders prior to transfer or release to the community under the terms of this compact; (j) establish a system of uniform data collection on information pertaining to juveniles subject to this compact that allows access by authorized juvenile justice and criminal justice
					 officials, and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and juvenile and criminal justice administrators; (k) monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of juveniles and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance; (l) coordinate training and education regarding the regulation of interstate movement of juveniles for officials involved in such activity; and (m) coordinate the implementation and operation of the compact with the Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children, the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision, and other compacts affecting juveniles particularly in those cases where concurrent or overlapping supervision issues arise. It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created herein are the formation of public policies and therefore are public business. Furthermore, the compacting states shall cooperate and observe their
					 individual and collective duties and responsibilities for the prompt return and acceptance of juveniles subject to the provisions of this compact. The provisions of this compact shall be reasonably and liberally construed to accomplish the purposes and policies of the compact. ARTICLE IIDEFINITIONS As used in this compact, unless the context clearly requires a different construction:(a) “Bylaws” means those bylaws established by the Interstate Commission for its governance, or for directing or controlling its actions or conduct.(b) “Compact Administrator” means the individual in each

The provisions of this compact and the rules promulgated hereunder shall be received by all the judges, public officers, commissions, and departments of the state government as evidence of the authorized statute and administrative rules. All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules. In any judicial or administrative proceeding in a compacting state pertaining to the subject matter of

					 the Interstate Commission.(D) Suspension or termination of membership in the compact, which shall be imposed only after all other reasonable means of securing compliance under the bylaws and rules have been exhausted and the Interstate Commission has therefore determined that the offending state is in default. Immediate notice of suspension shall be given by the Interstate Commission to the Governor, the Chief Justice or the Chief Judicial Officer of the state, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state’s legislature, and the state council. The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a compacting state to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this compact, the bylaws, or duly promulgated rules and any other grounds designated in commission bylaws and rules. The Interstate Commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the penalty imposed by the Interstate
					 Commission and of the default pending a cure of the default. The commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the commission, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination.(2) Within 60 days of the effective date of termination of a defaulting state, the commission shall notify the Governor, the Chief Justice or Chief Judicial Officer, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state’s legislature, and the state council of such termination.(3) The defaulting state is responsible for all assessments, obligations,
