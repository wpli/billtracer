This information is necessary for the Department of Finance to determine the proper beginning balance of the current fiscal year for budgetary purposes. To ensure timely completion of the
			 yearend financial data, the Controller should enforce provisions in Section 12461.2 of the Government Code and emphasize in its regulation the deadline the yearend financial statements are due from the operating departments to the Controller. 17.In the event new postage rates by the United States Postal Service are adopted, but not in time for inclusion in the 2009–10 May Revision, and the State Controller’s Office notifies the Department of Finance with their estimates of the increased postage costs within 15 calendar days of the adoption of new rates, the Director of Finance may authorize expenditures in excess of the amount appropriated in this item by an amount necessary to fund the postage increase.

Once the General Fund has been fully repaid, the Department of General Services shall adjust utility rates for all tenants to accurately reflect the current rates. 9.The Director of Finance is authorized to increase this item for purposes of funding tenant improvement projects to facilitate the backfill of vacant space within stand-alone Department of General Services (DGS) bond-funded office buildings.

Department of Finance approval is contingent upon justification for the proposed tenant improvement projects to be provided by the DGS including an analysis of cost impacts and how the tenant improvements will improve the state’s utilization of the facility.

			 consent of the Department of Finance.

In years when the Board of Administration adopts health premium increases in excess of those assumed in the most recent state retiree health program actuarial valuation, the report shall include a discussion of actions that the Board of Administration plans to take, if any, to attempt to reduce the rate of annual premium growth to levels below those assumed in this valuation for the next three years. This reporting
			 requirement applies to the Board of Administration’s action in 2009 to adopt premium rates for 2010 and all Board of Administration actions to increase or decrease annual health premiums adopted thereafter. This reporting requirement does not obligate the Board of Administration to adopt any specific level of premium for any given year or to change any action it otherwise determines is necessary under state law. The Board of Administration may state in the report that it is unable to commit to specific actions to reduce the rate of health premium growth or does not know if future reductions in the rate of health premium growth can be achieved. PERS is requested to complete these reports with existing budgetary and staffing resources. The report shall be submitted to the Chairperson of the Joint Legislative Budget Committee, the chairpersons of the committees and subcommittees in each house of the Legislature that consider PERS’ budget and activities, the Controller, the Director of Finance, and the
			 Legislative Analyst. 1900-015-0830—For support of Board of Administration of the Public Employees’ Retirement System, payable from the Public Employees’ Retirement Fund

		−704,000Provisions: 1.The General Fund support for poison control centers shall augment, but not replace, local expenditures for existing poison control center services. These funds shall be used primarily to increase services to underserved counties and populations and for poison prevention and information services. The Director of the Emergency Medical Services Authority may contract with eligible poison control centers for the distribution of these funds. 2.The Emergency Medical Services Authority shall use the following
			 guidelines in administering state-funded grants to local agencies: (a) funding eligibility shall be limited to rural multicounty regions that demonstrate a heavy use of the emergency medical services system by nonresidents, (b) local agencies shall provide matching funds of at least $1 for each dollar of state funds received, (c) state funding shall be used to provide only essential minimum services necessary to operate the system, as defined by the authority, (d) no region shall receive both federal and state funds in the same fiscal year for the same purpose, and (e) the Emergency Medical Services Authority shall monitor the use of the funds by recipients to ensure that these funds are used in an appropriate manner. 3.Each region shall be eligible to receive up to one-half of the total cost of a minimal system for that region, as
			 defined by the Emergency Medical Services Authority. However, the authority may reallocate unclaimed funds among regions. 4.Notwithstanding Provision 2(b), each region with a population of 300,000 or less as of June 30, 2007, shall receive the full amount for which it is eligible if it provides a cash match of $0.41 per capita or more. Failure to provide local cash contributions at the specified level shall result in a proportional reduction in state funding. 5.It is the intent of the Legislature that the Director of the Emergency Medical Services Authority provide assistance, when feasible, to poison control centers in seeking sources of funding other than
			 General Fund support, including grants from health-related foundations, federal grants, and assistance from the California Children and Families Commission, or other relevant entities. It is also the intent of the Legislature that poison control centers assertively seek and obtain funding from foundations, private-sector entities, the federal government, and sources other than the General Fund.4120-101-0890—For local assistance, Emergency Medical Services Authority, for payment to Item 4120-101-0001, payable from the Federal Trust Fund

		22,100,000Provisions: 1.The funds appropriated in this item are for transfer by the Controller during the 2009–10 fiscal year to Section B of the State School Fund. 2.Notwithstanding any other provision of law, apportionment funding for community college districts shall be based on the greater of the current year or prior year level of full-time equivalent students (FTES), consistent with K–12 declining enrollment practices pursuant to Section 42238.5 of the Education Code. Decreases in FTES shall result in a revenue reduction at the district’s average level of apportionment funding per FTES and shall be made in the year following the initial year of decrease in FTES. 3.The funds appropriated in Schedule (1) for Apportionments include $31,409,000 to encourage district-level accountability efforts pursuant to Section 84754.5 of the Education Code. It is intended that the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges submit an annual report on district-specific accountability measures by March 19 of each year. This report shall reflect outcomes from the most recently completed fiscal year for which data is available pursuant to Section 84754.5 of the Education Code. 4.Of the funds appropriated in Schedule (1), Apportionments:(a)Up to $100,000 is for a maintenance allowance, pursuant to Section 54200 of Title 5 of the California Code of Regulations.(b)Up to $500,000 is to reimburse colleges for the costs of federal aid repayments related to assessed fees for fee waiver recipients. This reimbursement only applies to students who completely withdraw from college before the census date pursuant to Section 58508 of Title 5 of the California Code of Regulations.5.Of the amount appropriated in Schedule (1), $10,000,000 shall only be available for noncredit instruction to prepare pupils to pass the California High School Exit
			 Examination (CAHSEE). The first priority shall be to serve high school pupils from the classes of 2007 and 2008 who met all other graduation requirements except for passage of the CAHSEE. Remaining funds may be used to support other necessary noncredit courses for other pupils who not only did not pass the CAHSEE, but who did not complete other coursework necessary to meet high school graduation requirements. These funds are intended to supplement but not supplant existing funding for these purposes. 6.Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges shall not reduce district workload obligations for a lack of a funded cost-of-living adjustment. 7.(a)Of the amount appropriated in Schedule (2) for the Apprenticeship Program, up to $14,641,000 shall be available as necessary upon certification by the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges for the purpose of funding community college-related and supplemental instruction pursuant to Section 3074 of the Labor Code, as provided in Section 8152 of the Education Code. No community college district shall use funds available under this provision to offer any new apprenticeship training program or the expansion of any existing program unless the new program or expansion has been approved by the chancellor.(b)Notwithstanding Section 8152 of the Education Code, each 60-minute hour of teaching time devoted to each
			 indentured apprentice enrolled in and attending classes of related and supplemental instruction as provided under Section 3074 of the Labor Code shall be reimbursed at the rate of $5.06 per hour. For purposes of this provision, each hour of teaching time may include up to 10 minutes for passing time and breaks.8.Funds appropriated in Schedule (3), Growth for Apportionments, shall be available first to any districts bringing online in the current fiscal year newly accredited colleges or California Postsecondary Education Commission-approved educational centers. It is the intent of the Legislature that increases in basic foundation allocations to each college be funded prior to additional growth in full-time equivalent students. The Chancellor of the California Community Colleges shall provide a report by November 1 of each year, to
			 the Department of Finance and the Legislative Analyst, on the number of new centers and colleges added for the current fiscal year and those anticipated to be added for the prospective budget year. This report shall also detail the specific funding adjustments provided for basic foundation allocations to each college and center for the current fiscal year. 9.Notwithstanding any other provision of law, funds appropriated in Schedule (3) for Growth for Apportionments shall only be allocated for growth in full-time equivalent students (FTES), on a district-by-district basis, as determined by the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges. The chancellor shall not include any FTES from concurrent enrollment in physical education, dance, recreation, study skills, and personal development courses and other courses in conflict with
			 existing law for the purpose of calculating a district’s three-year overcap adjustment. The Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges shall implement the criteria required by subdivision (a) of Provision 5 of Item 6870-101-0001 of the Budget Act of 2003 (Ch. 157, Stats. 2003) for the allocation of funds appropriated in Schedules (1) and (3), so as to ensure that courses related to student needs for transfer, basic skills, and vocational/workforce training are accorded the highest priority and are provided to the maximum extent possible within budgeted funds.10.The funds appropriated in Schedule (4), Student Success for Basic Skills Students, shall be allocated as follows:(a)$1,600,000 for faculty and staff development to improve curriculum, instruction, student services, and program practices in the areas of basic skills and English as a Second Language (ESL) programs. The Office of the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges shall select a district, utilizing a competitive process, to carry out these faculty and staff development activities. All colleges receiving funds pursuant to subdivision (b) shall be provided with the opportunity to participate in the faculty and staff development programs specified in this subdivision. The chancellor shall report on the use of these funds by the selected district to the Legislative Analyst and the Department of Finance not later than September 1, 2010.(b)$31,500,000 for allocation by the chancellor to community college districts for improving outcomes of students who enter college needing at least one course in ESL or basic skills, with particular emphasis on students transitioning from high school.(c)Funding specified in subdivisions (a) and (b) shall be distributed to eligible applicants pursuant to Chapter 489 of the Statutes of 2007.(d)The Office of the Chancellor shall work jointly with the Department of Finance and the Legislative Analyst to develop annual accountability measures for this program. It is the intent of the
			 Legislature that annual performance accountability measures for this program utilize, to the extent possible, data available as part of the accountability system developed pursuant to Section 84754.5 of the Education Code. By November 1, 2010, the chancellor shall submit a report to the Governor and Legislature on the annual accountability measures developed pursuant to this process.11.(a)Of the funds appropriated in Schedule (5) for Student Financial Aid Administration, not less than $10,561,000 is available to provide $0.91 per unit reimbursement to community college districts for the provision of board of governors (BOG) fee waiver awards pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (m) of Section 76300 of the Education Code.(b)Of the funds appropriated in Schedule (5), not less than $4,642,000 is available to provide reimbursement of 2 percent of total waiver value to community college districts for the provision of BOG fee waiver awards pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (m) of Section 76300 of the Education Code.(c)Funding provided to community college districts in subdivisions (a) and (b) of this provision is provided to directly offset any mandated costs claimed by community college districts pursuant to Commission on State Mandates Test Claims 99-TC-13 (Enrollment Fee Collection) and 00-TC-15 (Enrollment Fee Waivers).(d)(1)Of the amount appropriated in Schedule (5), $2,800,000 shall be for a contract with a community college district to conduct a statewide media campaign to promote the general message to prospective students as follows: (A) the California Community Colleges (CCC) remain affordable, (B) financial aid and tax credits are available to cover enrollment fees and help with books and other costs, and (C) the active encouragement of contact between pupils and local CCC financial aid offices. Any funds used from this source to produce radio, television, or mail campaigns must emphasize the availability of financial aid, the easiest and most reliable method of accessing the aid, a contact telephone number, an Internet Web site address, where applicable, and the physical location of a financial aid office. Any mail campaign must
			 give priority to existing pupils, recent high school graduates, and 12th graders. The outreach and information campaign should target its efforts in high schools, welfare offices, unemployment offices, churches, community centers, and any other location that will most effectively reach low-income and disadvantaged students who must overcome barriers in accessing postsecondary education. The community college district awarded the contract shall consult with the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges and the Student Aid Commission prior to performing any activities to ensure appropriate coordination with any other state efforts in this area and ensure compliance with this provision.(2)Of the amount appropriated in Schedule (5), not more than $34,200,000 shall be for
			 direct contact with potential and current financial aid applicants. Each CCC campus shall receive a minimum allocation of $50,000. The remainder of the funding shall be allocated to campuses based upon a formula reflecting full-time equivalent students (FTES) weighted by a measure of low-income populations as demonstrated by BOG fee waiver program participation within a district. It is the intent of the Legislature, to the extent that funds are provided in this item, that all campuses provide additional staff resources to increase both financial aid participation and student access to low-income and disadvantaged students who must overcome barriers in accessing postsecondary education. Funds may be used for screening current students for possible financial aid eligibility and offering personal assistance to these students in accessing financial aid, providing individual help in multiple languages for families and students in filling out the necessary paperwork to apply for financial aid, and increasing
			 financial aid staff to process additional financial aid forms.(3)Funding provided to community college districts in Subdivision (d)(2) of Provision 11 is provided to directly offset any mandated costs claimed by community college districts pursuant to the Commission on State Mandates test claim 02-TC-28 (Cal Grants).(4)Funds allocated to a community college district for financial aid personnel, outreach determination of financial need, and delivery of student financial aid services shall supplement, and shall not supplant, the level of funds
			 allocated for the administration of student financial aid programs during the 2001–02 fiscal year or 2006–07 whichever is greater.(5)It is the intent of the Legislature that the Office of the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges provide the Legislature with a report not later than April 1, 2010, on the use of the funds allocated pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision (d), including the distribution of the funds, specific uses of the funds, strategies employed to reach low-income and disadvantaged students potentially eligible for financial aid, and the extent to which districts were successful in increasing the number of students accessing financial aid, particularly the maximum Pell Grant award.(6)It is the intent of the Legislature that the chancellor report by May 15, 2010, in the manner and using the factors set forth in paragraph (5) of subdivision (c) of Provision 11 of Item 6870-101-0001 of the Budget Act of 2007, on the impact of outreach efforts on student headcount and FTES enrollment for the 2006–07 and 2007–08 academic years.12.(a)The funds appropriated in Schedule (6) for the Disabled Students Program are for assisting districts in funding the excess direct instructional cost of providing special support services or instruction, or both, to disabled students enrolled at community colleges, and for
			 state hospital programs, as mandated by federal law.(b)Of the amount appropriated in Schedule (6), no less than $3,945,000 shall be used to address deficiencies identified by the federal Office of Civil Rights (OCR), as determined by the Office of the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges.(c)Of the amount appropriated in Schedule (6), at least $943,000 shall be used for support of the High Tech Centers for activities including, but not limited to, training of district employees, staff, and students in the use of specialized computer equipment for the disabled. All High Tech Centers shall
			 meet standards developed by the Office of the Chancellor. Colleges that receive these augmentations shall not supplant existing resources provided to the centers.(d)Notwithstanding any other provision of law, of the funds appropriated in Schedule (6), $1,246,000 shall be for state hospital adult education programs at the hospitals served by the Coast and Kern Community College Districts since the 1986–87 fiscal year. If adult education services at any of the three hospitals are not supported by the community colleges in any portion of the 2009–10 fiscal year, remaining funds shall, upon order of the Department of Finance, after 30 days’ notice to the Chairperson of the Joint Legislative Budget Committee, be transferred to the State Department of Developmental Services (DDS). For any transfer of funds to
			 DDS during the 2009–10 fiscal year, the Proposition 98 base funding levels for community colleges and DDS shall be adjusted accordingly.(e)Of the funds appropriated in Schedule (6) for the Disabled Student Services, no less than $9,600,000 shall be allocated to support high-cost sign language interpreter services and real-time captioning equipment or other communication accommodations for hearing-impaired students based on a 4-to-1 state-to-local district match.13.The funds appropriated in Schedule (7), Special Services for CalWORKs Recipients, are for the purpose of assisting welfare recipient students and those in transition
			 off of welfare to achieve long-term self-sufficiency through coordinated student services offered at community colleges, including workstudy, other educational related work experience, job placement services, child care services, and coordination with county welfare offices to determine eligibility and availability of services. All services funded in Schedule (7) shall be for current CalWORKs recipients or prior CalWORKs recipients who are in transition off of cash assistance for no more than two years. Current cash-assistance recipients may utilize these services until their initial educational objectives are met. Former recipients in transition off of cash assistance may utilize these services for a period of up to two years after leaving cash assistance subject to the conditions of this provision. These funds shall be used to supplement and not supplant existing funds and services provided for CalWORKs recipients attending community colleges. The Chancellor of the California Community Colleges shall
			 develop an equitable method for allocating funds to all districts and colleges based on the relative numbers of CalWORKs recipients in attendance and shall allocate funds for the following purposes:(a)Job placement.(b)Coordination with county welfare offices and other local agencies, including local workforce investment boards.(c)Curriculum development and redesign.(d)Child care and workstudy.(e)Instruction.(f)Postemployment skills training and related skills.(g)Campus-based case management, limited to on-campus assistance and services not provided by county case workers that
			 do not supplant other counseling and academic support services funded through existing California Community Colleges categorical programs.Of the amount appropriated in Schedule (7), $15,000,000 is for child care and does not require a district match. For the remaining funds, districts shall, as a condition of receipt of these funds, provide a $1 match for every $1 provided by the state.Funds utilized for subsidized child care shall be for children of CalWORKs recipients through campus-based centers or parental choice vouchers at rates and with rules consistent with those applied to related programs operated by the State
			 Department of Education in the 2009–10 fiscal year, including eligibility, reimbursement rates, and parental contribution schedules. Subsidized campus child care for CalWORKs recipients may be provided during the period they are engaged in qualifying state and federal work activities through attainment of their initial education and training plan and for up to three months thereafter or until the end of the academic year, whichever period of time is greater.Funds utilized for workstudy shall be used solely for payments to employers that currently participate in campus-based workstudy programs or are providing work experiences that are directly related to and in furtherance of student educational programs and work participation requirements, provided that those payments may not exceed 75 percent of the wage for the
			 workstudy positions, and the employers shall pay at least 25 percent of the wage for the workstudy positions. These funds may be expended only if the total hours of education, employment, and workstudy for the student are sufficient to meet both state and federal minimum requirements for qualifying work-related activities.Funds may be used to provide credit or noncredit classes for CalWORKs students if a district has committed all of its funded full-time equivalent students (FTES) and is unable to offer the additional instructional services to meet the demand for CalWORKs students. This determination shall be based on fall enrollment information. Districts shall submit applications to the Office of the Chancellor by October 15 of each year. If the chancellor approves the use of funds for direct instructional
			 workload, the Office of the Chancellor shall submit a report to the Department of Finance and the Joint Legislative Budget Committee by November 15, 2009, that (a) identifies the enrollment of new CalWORKs students, (b) states whether and why additional classes were needed to accommodate the needs of CalWORKs students, and (c) sets forth an expenditure plan for the balance of funds.As a condition of receipt of the funds appropriated in Schedule (7), by the fourth week following the end of the semester or quarter term commencing in January 2010, each participating community college shall submit to the Office of the Chancellor a report, in the format specified by the chancellor in consultation with the State Department of Social Services, that includes, but is not limited to, the funded components, the number of
			 hours of child care provided, the average monthly enrollment of CalWORKs dependents served in child care, the number of workstudy hours provided, the hourly salaries and type of jobs, the number of students being case managed, the short-term programs available, the student participation rates, and other outcome data. It is intended that, to the extent practical, reporting from colleges utilize data gathered for federal reporting requirements at the state and local level. Further, it is intended that the Office of the Chancellor compile the information for annual reports to the Legislature, the Governor, the Legislative Analyst, the Department of Finance, and the State Department of Social Services by November 15 of each year.First priority for expenditures of any funds appropriated in Schedule (7) shall be in
			 support of current CalWORKs recipients. However, if caseloads are insufficient to fully utilize all of the funding in this schedule in a cost-beneficial way, it is intended that up to $5,000,000 of the funds subject to local matching requirements may be allocated for providing postemployment services to former CalWORKs recipients who have been off of cash assistance for no longer than two years to assist them in upgrading skills, job retention, and advancement. Allowable services include direct instruction that cannot be funded under available growth funding, child care to support attendance in these classes consistent with this provision, job development and placement services, and career counseling and assessment activities which cannot be funded through other programs. Child care services may only be provided for periods commensurate with a student’s need for postemployment training within the two-year transitional period.Prior to allocation of funds for postemployment services, the chancellor shall first secure the approval of the Department of Finance for the allocations, complete a cumulative report on the outcomes, activities, and cost-effectiveness of the program no later than November 15, 2009, in compliance with the Budget Acts of 1998 (Ch. 324, Stats. 1998) and 1999 (Ch. 50, Stats. 1999) and this act, and shall provide the rationale and justification for the proposed allocation of postemployment services to districts for transitional students.If a district is unable to fully expend its share of child care funds, it may request that the Office of the Chancellor approve a reallocation to other CalWORKs purposes
			 authorized by this provision, subject to all pertinent limitations and district match required for these purposes under this provision.Of the funds appropriated in Schedule (7) for the Special Services for CalWORKs Recipients Program, no less than $8,000,000 is to provide direct workstudy wage reimbursement for students served under this program, and $1,000,000 is available for campus job development and placement services.14.Funds appropriated in Schedule (7) for the Special Services for CalWORKs Recipients Program have been budgeted to meet the state’s Temporary Assistance for Needy Families maintenance-of-effort requirement pursuant to
			 the federal Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-193) and may not be expended in any way that would cause their disqualification as a federally allowable maintenance-of-effort expenditure. 15.(a)Funds provided in Schedule (8) for the Foster Care Education Program shall be allocated to provide foster and relative/kinship care education and training. Districts shall ensure that education and training required by Sections 1529.1 and 1529.2 of the Health and Safety Code and Section 16003 of the Welfare and Institutions Code receive priority. Districts may use any remaining funds for additional parenting skills training.(b)Funds provided in Schedule (8) shall be used for foster parent and relative/kinship care provider education training services consistent with the following criteria:(1)The Chancellor of the California Community Colleges shall use these funds exclusively for foster parent and relative/kinship care provider education and training, as specified by the chancellor in consultation with an advisory committee that includes foster parents, representatives of statewide foster parent organizations, parent and relative/kinship care providers, and representatives from the State Department of Social Services.(2)Acceptance of funds under this program shall constitute agreement by the district to comply with such reporting requirements, guidelines, and other conditions for receipt of funding as the chancellor may establish.(3)Each college plan for foster and relative/kinship care education programs shall include the provision of training to facilitate the development of foster family homes, small family homes, and relative/kinship homes to care for no more than six children who have special mental, emotional, developmental, or physical needs.(4)The State Department of Social Services shall facilitate the participation of county welfare departments in the foster and relative/kinship care education program.16.(a)Funds appropriated in Schedule (9) for the Matriculation Program are for the purpose of student matriculation pursuant to Article 1 (commencing with Section 78210) of Chapter 2 of Part 48 of Division 7 of Title 3 of the Education Code.(b)Of the amount appropriated in Schedule (9),
			 $20,000,000 shall be allocated to community college districts on a one-to-one matching funds basis to provide matriculation services, including, but not limited to, orientation, assessment, and counseling, for students enrolled in designated noncredit classes and programs who may benefit most, as determined by the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges pursuant to Sections 78216 to 78218, inclusive, of the Education Code.17.The funds in Schedule (13) for the Part-time Faculty Compensation Program shall be allocated solely to increase compensation for part-time faculty from the amounts previously authorized.

		125,000SEC. 24.00.For each fiscal year, the donations and oil and mineral revenues from federal lands that
		  are deposited in the State School Fund shall be divided between Sections A and B of the State School Fund, with 85 percent of these revenues to be credited to Section A of the fund exclusively for regular apportionments for school districts serving pupils in kindergarten or any of grades 1 to 12, inclusive, and 15 percent to Section B of the fund exclusively for community college district regular apportionments. The amounts accruing to the State School Fund under this section shall be disbursed fully before any General Fund transfers to Section A or B of the State School Fund are disbursed for regular apportionments.SEC. 24.03. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, funds appropriated by Section 2.00, 8.50, 28.00, 28.50, or any other provision of this act may not be expended for the support of any program, network, or material, with the exception of instruction to pupils who are identified as deaf or hearing impaired pursuant to paragraphs (3) and (5) of Section 300.8(c) of Title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations, that promotes or uses reading instruction methodologies that emphasize contextual clues in lieu of fluent decoding. SEC. 24.10. (a) Notwithstanding Section 1464 of the Penal Code or Section 41304 of the Education Code, the first $1,626,000 received by the Driver Training Penalty Assessment Fund for the 2009–10 fiscal year shall be available for the purposes of Item 6110-001-0178 of Section 2.00. The amount retained by the Driver Training Penalty Assessment Fund for the purposes of Item 6110-001-0178 may be adjusted by the Department of Finance for actions pursuant to any section of this act.(b) After moneys are retained by the Driver Training Penalty Assessment Fund pursuant to subdivision (a), the Controller shall transfer any remaining balances as follows: $4,121,000 to the Victim-Witness Assistance Fund; $9,800,000 to the Corrections
		  Training Fund; and $14,000,000 to the Peace Officers’ Training Fund. Any remaining unallocated moneys in the Driver Training Penalty Assessment Fund shall be transferred to the General Fund. SEC. 24.30. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Controller, upon the order of the Director of Finance, shall transfer sale and lease revenues received pursuant to Sections 17089 and 17089.2 of the Education Code, in an amount determined by the Department of Finance, from the State School Building Aid Fund to the General Fund.SEC. 24.65. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Director of Finance is authorized to repay General Fund budgetary obligations, infrastructure bond debts, and the Economic Recovery Bonds, including reimbursement to the General Fund for these costs, in the 2009–10 fiscal year from the Debt Retirement Fund, pursuant to Government Code Section 8880.4.5. (b) Expenditures and reimbursements authorized by this section will result in overall General Fund savings. It is not the intent of the Legislature in enacting this section to provide additional expenditure authority to state programs. SEC. 24.70. From the funds appropriated to the State Department of Education for local assistance, the department shall ensure that the expenditure of funds allocated to a local educational agency (LEA), through a contract between the department and the LEA or through a grant from the department to the LEA, shall be subject to the LEA’s fiscal accountability policies and procedures. If it is necessary for the LEA to establish a separate entity to complete the work scope of the contract or grant, the fiscal accountability policies and procedures for that entity shall be the same as those of the LEA, or amended only with the approval of both the superintendent of schools of the LEA and a fiscal representative of the department designated by the Superintendent of Public Instruction. Further, the department shall
		  have the authority to provide for an audit of the expenditures under the contract or grant between the department and the LEA to verify conformance with appropriate fiscal accountability policies and procedures. The cost of the audit, if required, shall be charged to the audited contract or grant. SEC. 25.50. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an amount not to exceed $841,000 is hereby appropriated from various funds to the Controller, as specified below, for reimbursement of costs for the ongoing maintenance and support of the Apportionment Payment System:0046Public Transportation Account

		$841,000The Controller shall assess these funds for the costs of the Apportionment Payment System because apportionment payments in excess of $10,000,000 are made annually from these funds. Assessments in support of the expenditures for the Apportionment Payment System shall be made monthly, and the total amount assessed from these funds may not exceed the total expenditures incurred by the Controller for the Apportionment Payment System for the 2009–10 fiscal year. SEC. 26.00. (a) It is the intent of the Legislature, in enacting this section, to provide flexibility for the administrative approval of intraschedule transfers within individual items of appropriation in those instances where the transfers are necessary for the efficient and cost-effective implementation of the programs, projects, and functions funded by this act. No transfer shall be authorized under this section to either eliminate any program, project, or function, except when implementation is found to be no longer feasible in light of changing circumstances or new information, or establish any new program, project, or function. (b) The Director of Finance may, pursuant to a request by the officer, department, division,
		  bureau, board, commission, or other agency to which an appropriation is made by this act, authorize the augmentation of the amount available for expenditure in any schedule set forth for that appropriation, by making a transfer from any of the other designated programs, projects, or functions within the same schedule. No intraschedule transfer may be made under this section to fund any capital outlay purpose, regardless of whether budgeted in a capital outlay or a local assistance appropriation. Upon the conclusion of the 2009–10 fiscal year, the Director of Finance shall furnish the chairpersons of the committees in each house of the Legislature that consider appropriations and the State Budget, and the Chairperson of the Joint Legislative Budget Committee, with a report on all authorizations given pursuant to this section during that fiscal year.(c) Intraschedule transfers of the amounts available for expenditure for a program, project, or
		  function designated in any line of any schedule set forth for that appropriation by transfer from any of the other designated programs, projects, or functions within the same schedule shall not exceed, during any fiscal year: (1) 20 percent of the amount so scheduled on that line for those appropriations made by this act that are $2,000,000 or less. (2) $400,000 of the amount so scheduled on that line for those appropriations made by this act that are more than $2,000,000 but equal to or less than $4,000,000.(3) 10 percent of the amount so scheduled on that line for those appropriations made by this act that are more than $4,000,000. (4) The Department of Transportation Highway Program shall be limited to a schedule change of 10 percent.(d) Any transfer in excess of $200,000 may be authorized pursuant to this section not sooner than 30 days after notification in writing of the necessity therefor is provided to the chairpersons of the committees in each house of the Legislature that consider appropriations and the Chairperson of the Joint Legislative Budget Committee, or not sooner than whatever lesser time the Chairperson of the Joint Legislative Budget Committee, or his or her designee, may in each instance determine. (e) Any transfer in excess of the limitations provided in subdivision (c) may be authorized not sooner than 30 days after notification in writing of the necessity to exceed the limitations is provided to the chairpersons of the committees in each house of the Legislature that consider appropriations and the Chairperson of the Joint Legislative Budget Committee or his or her designee, may in each
		  instance determine. SEC. 28.00. (a) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this section to provide flexibility for administrative approval of augmentations for the expenditure of unanticipated federal funds or other nonstate funds in cases that meet the criteria set forth in this section. However, this section does not provide an alternative budget process, and proposals for additional spending ordinarily should be considered in the annual State Budget or other state legislation. Specifically, augmentations for items which the administration had knowledge to include in its 2009–10 budget plan should not be submitted through the process provided by this section. Augmentations for items which can be deferred to 2010–11 should be included in the administration’s 2010–11 budget proposals.(b) The Director of Finance may authorize the augmentation of the amount available for expenditure for any program, project, or function in the schedule of any appropriation in this act or any additional program, project, or function equal to the amount of any additional, unanticipated funds that he or she estimates will be received by the state during the 2009–10 fiscal year from any agency of local government or the federal government, or from any other nonstate source, provided that the additional funding meets all of the following requirements:(1) The funds will be expended for a purpose that is consistent with state law.(2) The funds are made available to the state under conditions permitting their use only for a specified purpose, and the additional expenditure proposed under this section would apply to that
		  specified funding purpose.(3) Acceptance of the additional funding does not impose on the state any requirement to commit or expend new state funds for any program or purpose.(4) The need exists to expend the additional funding during the 2009–10 fiscal year.(c) In order to receive consideration for an augmentation, an agency shall either (1) notify the director within 45 days of receiving official notice of the availability of additional, unanticipated funds, or (2) explain in writing to the director why that notification was infeasible or impractical. In either case, the recipient agency shall provide the director a copy of the official notice of fund availability.(d) The director also may reduce any program, project, or function whenever he or
		  she determines that funds to be received will be less than the amount taken into consideration in the schedule.(e) Any augmentation or reduction that exceeds either (1) $400,000 or (2) 10 percent of the amount available for expenditure in the affected program, project, or function may be authorized not sooner than 30 days after notification in writing of the necessity therefor is provided to the chairpersons of the committees in each house of the Legislature that consider appropriations, the chairpersons of the committees, and the appropriate subcommittees, in each house of the Legislature that consider the State Budget, and the Chairperson of the Joint Legislative Budget Committee, or not sooner than whatever lesser time the Chairperson of the Joint Legislative Budget Committee, or his or her designee, may in each instance determine. With regard to any proposed augmentation, the notification shall state the basis for the determination by the
		  director that the augmentation meets each of the requirements set forth in subdivisions (b) and (c). This notification shall include the date that the recipient department received official notice of the additional funds, and a copy of the agency’s written explanation if a 45-day notice was not provided to the director. This notification requirement does not apply to federal funds related to caseload increases in Medi-Cal, California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs), and Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Program (SSI/SSP).(f) Any personnel action that is dependent on funds subject to this section shall not be effective until after the provisions of this section have been complied with. Any authorization made pursuant to this section shall remain in effect for the period the director may determine in each instance, but in no event after June 30, 2010.SEC. 28.50. (a) Except as otherwise provided by law, an officer, department, division, bureau, or other agency of the state may expend for the 2009–10 fiscal year all moneys received as reimbursement from another officer, department, division, bureau, or other agency of the state that has not been taken into consideration by this act or any other statute, upon the prior written approval of the Director of Finance. The Department of Finance may also reduce any reimbursement amount and related program, project, or function amount if funds received from another officer, department, division, bureau, or other agency of the state will be less than the amount taken into consideration in the schedule. (b) For any expenditure of
		  reimbursements or any transfer for the 2009–10 fiscal year that exceeds $200,000, the Director of Finance shall provide notification in writing of any approval granted under this section, not less than 30 days prior to the effective date of that approval, to the chairpersons of the committees in each house of the Legislature that consider appropriations, the chairpersons of the committees and the appropriate subcommittees in each house of the Legislature that consider the State Budget, and the Chairperson of the Joint Legislative Budget Committee, or not sooner than whatever lesser time the Chairperson of the Joint Legislative Budget Committee, or his or her designee, may in each instance determine. Increases to reimbursements are not reportable under this section if the funding for the other officer, department, division, bureau, or other agency of the state providing the reimbursement has already been approved by the Legislature. These adjustments are considered technical in nature and are authorized in
		  Section 1.50.SEC. 29.00. The Department of Finance shall calculate and publish a listing of total personnel-years and estimated salary savings for each department and agency. These listings shall be published by the Department of Finance at the same time as the publication of (a) the Governor’s Budget, (b) the May Revision, and (c) the Final Change Book. (a) The listing provided at the time of the publication of the Governor’s Budget shall contain estimates of personnel-years for the prior year, current year, and budget year. (b) The listing provided at the time of publication of the May Revision shall contain estimates of personnel-years proposed for the budget year. (c) The listing provided at the time of the publication of the Final Change Book shall contain estimates of personnel-years for the fiscal year just enacted. SEC. 30.00. Section 13340 of the Government Code is amended to read:13340. (a) Except as provided in subdivision (b), on and after July 1, 2010, no moneys in any fund that, by any statute other than a Budget Act, are continuously appropriated without regard to fiscal years, may be encumbered unless the Legislature, by statute, specifies that the moneys in the fund are appropriated for encumbrance. (b) Subdivision (a) does not apply to any of the following: (1) The scheduled disbursement of any local sales and use tax proceeds to an entity of local government pursuant to Part 1.5 (commencing with Section 7200) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. (2) The scheduled disbursement of any transactions
				  and use tax proceeds to an entity of local government pursuant to Part 1.6 (commencing with Section 7251) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. (3) The scheduled disbursement of any funds by a state or local agency or department that issues bonds and administers related programs for which funds are continuously appropriated as of June 30, 2009. (4) Moneys that are deposited in proprietary or fiduciary funds of the California State University and that are continuously appropriated without regard to fiscal years. (5) The scheduled disbursement of any motor vehicle license fee revenues to an entity of local government pursuant to the Vehicle License Fee Law (Part 5 (commencing with Section 10701) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code). SEC. 31.00. (a) The appropriations made by this act shall be subject, unless otherwise provided by law, to Section 13320 and Article 2.5 (commencing with Section 13332) of Chapter 3 of Part 3 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, requiring expenditures to be made in accordance with the allotments and other provisions of fiscal year budgets approved by the Department of Finance.(b) The fiscal year budgets shall authorize, in the manner that the Department of Finance shall prescribe, all established positions whose continuance for the year is approved and all new positions. No new position shall be established unless authorized by the Department of Finance on the basis of work program and organization.(c) The Department of Finance shall, for a period of not less than two years, keep and preserve documentation concerning (1) the authorization of any position not authorized for that fiscal year by the Legislature and (2) any reclassification to a position with a minimum step per month of $6,808, which is equivalent to the top step of the Staff Services Manager II (Managerial) classification as of July 1, 2009. The department may use electronic means to keep and preserve this documentation.(d) It is the intent of the Legislature that all positions administratively established pursuant to this section that are intended by the administration to be ongoing be submitted to the Legislature for approval through the regular budget process as soon as possible. All positions administratively established pursuant to this section during the 2009–10 fiscal year shall terminate on June 30, 2010,
		  except for those positions that have been (1) approved by the Legislature as part of the regular budget process for the 2010–11 fiscal year as new positions, or (2) approved by the Department of Finance after the 2010–11 Governor’s Budget submission to the Legislature and subsequently reported to the Legislature prior to July 1, 2010. The positions identified in (2) above may be reestablished by the Department of Finance during the 2010–11 fiscal year, provided that these positions are shown in the Governor’s Budget for the 2011–12 fiscal year as submitted to the Legislature, and provided that these positions do not result in the reestablishment of positions deleted by the Legislature through the budget process for the 2010–11 fiscal year. The Department of Finance will notify the Legislature within 30 days of the reestablishment of positions approved in the 2010–11 fiscal year pursuant to (2) above.(e) Moneys appropriated in the 2009–10
		  fiscal year may be expended for increases in salary ranges or any other employee compensation action only if appropriated for that purpose, or if the Department of Finance certifies to the salary and other compensation-setting authority, prior to the adoption of the action, that funds are available to pay the increased salary or employee compensation resulting from the action. Prior to certification, the Department of Finance shall determine whether the increase in salary range or employee compensation action will require supplemental funding in the 2010–11 fiscal year. If the Department of Finance determines that supplemental funding will be required, the department may certify only if it notifies in writing, at least 30 days before, the chairpersons of the committees in each house of the Legislature that consider appropriations and the Chairperson of the Joint Legislative Budget Committee, or a lesser time which the chairperson of the joint committee, or his or her designee, determines.(f) A certification on a payroll claim that expenditures therein are in accordance with current budgetary provisions as approved by the Department of Finance shall be sufficient evidence to the Controller that these expenditures comply with this section.SEC. 32.00. (a) The officers of the various departments, boards, commissions, and institutions, for whose benefit and support appropriations are made in this act, are expressly forbidden to make any expenditures in excess of these appropriations. Any indebtedness attempted to be created against the state in violation of this section shall be null and void, and shall not be allowed by the Controller nor paid out of any state appropriation.(b) Any member of a department, board, commission, or institution who shall vote for any expenditure, or create any indebtedness against the state in excess of the respective appropriations made by this act shall be liable both personally and on his or her official bond for the amount of the
		  indebtedness, to be recovered in any court of competent jurisdiction by the person or persons, firm, or corporation to which the indebtedness is owing. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of law, a person may not be held personally liable for the amount of any indebtedness created by an expenditure in excess of an appropriation made by this act if all of the following occur: (1) the expenditure is in response to increases in enrollment, population, or caseload by the State Department of Social Services, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, the State Department of Developmental Services, the State Department of Mental Health, the State Department of Health Care Services, or the State Department of Public Health; (2) that expenditure is incurred no sooner than 30 days after the Director of Finance provides written notification of its necessity to the Chairperson of the Joint Legislative Budget Committee; and (3) if the chairperson does not advise in response that the expenditure
		  shall not occur. The director’s notification shall include a certification of any amounts required by enrollment, population, or caseload, rather than management decisions or policy changes.(c) Neither subdivision (a) nor (b) applies to the expenditure of moneys to fund continuous appropriations, including appropriations made in the California Constitution, and federal laws mandating the expenditure of funds.SEC. 33.00. If any item of appropriation in this act is vetoed, eliminated, or reduced by the Governor under Section 10 of Article IV of the California Constitution, while approving portions of this act, such veto, elimination, or reduction shall not affect the other portions of this act, and these other portions of this act, so approved, shall have the same effect in law as if any vetoed or eliminated items of appropriation had not been present in this act, and as if any reduced item of appropriation had not been reduced. SEC. 34.00. If any portion of this act is held unconstitutional, that decision shall not affect the validity of any other portion of this act. The Legislature hereby declares that it would have passed this act, and each portion thereof, irrespective of the fact that any other portion be declared unconstitutional. SEC. 35.20. If legislation is enacted amending Section 13302 of the Government Code to allow the accrual of tax payments due more than two months after the close of the fiscal year for transactions occurring in the prior fiscal year, the Department of Finance shall provide guidance pursuant to Section 13310 of the Government Code with respect to the methodology to be employed in determining accruals and the timing of implementation of any changes in tax accrual practices. This change to accrual treatment of corporation and franchise tax payments and all of the change to the treatment of personal income tax payments shall apply to the 2007–08 fiscal year. SEC. 35.50.  (a) For purposes of paragraph (1) of subdivision (f) of Section 10, and subdivision (f) of Section 12, of Article IV of the California Constitution, “General Fund revenues” means the total resources available to the General Fund for a fiscal year before any transfer to the Budget Stabilization Account. (b) For purposes of subdivision (f) of Section 12 of Article IV of the California Constitution, “all appropriations from the General Fund for that fiscal year” shall not include any transfer to the Budget Stabilization Account to retire Economic Recovery Bonds because that amount is reflected in the “amount of any General Fund moneys transferred to the Budget Stabilization Account.”(c) For purposes of subdivision (f) of Section 12 of Article IV of the California Constitution, the estimate of General Fund revenues for the 2009–10 fiscal year pursuant to this act, as passed by the Legislature, is $98,787,400,000. (d) For purposes of subdivision (b) of Section 20 of Article XVI of the California Constitution, General Fund revenues shall be defined as revenues and transfers before any transfer to the Budget Stabilization Account, excluding any proceeds from Economic Recovery Bonds, as estimated in the enacted State Budget. SEC. 35.60. (a) Whenever the Director of Finance determines that there is a shortfall in the General Fund reserve, the director shall order the transfer from the Budget Stabilization Account to the General Fund the amount determined by the Director of Finance to be sufficient to ensure there is a prudent General Fund reserve. Upon receipt of the order from the Director of Finance, the Controller shall make the transfer in the amount ordered. (b) The Director of Finance shall notify the Chairperson of the Joint Legislative Budget Committee and the chairpersons of the committees of each house of the Legislature that consider appropriations not more than 15 days after ordering the transfer pursuant to this section.
		  SEC. 36.00. This act, inasmuch as it provides for appropriations for the usual and current expenses of the state, shall, under the provisions of Section 8 of Article IV of the California Constitution, take effect immediately. SEC. 37.00. This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are: This act makes appropriations and contains related provisions for support of state and local government for the 2009–10 fiscal year and provides for capital outlay appropriations in continuance of existing programs and to promote and sustain the economy of the state. It is imperative that these appropriations be made available for expenditure not later than July 1, 2009. It is therefore necessary that this act go into immediate effect. INDEX BY BUDGET TITLESEC. 99.00. The following provides an index to the appropriations and related provisions of this act, by organization in alphabetical order, with the code number of the affected organization. The organization code is the first four numbers of any item number in this act. For ease of reference, the appropriation items in this act are organized in numerical order, and all of the appropriation items for any one organization are adjacent to one another.
