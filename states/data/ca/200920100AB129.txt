											  Confidentiality: taxpayer communications.Under existing law, the Employment Development Department, the State Board of Equalization, and the Franchise Tax Board administer various taxes and fees.This bill in modified conformity with federal income tax laws would, with respect to tax advice, require that certain protections of confidentiality that apply to a communication between a client and an attorney also apply to communications between a taxpayer and any federally authorized tax practitioner that appears before those state agencies to the extent that the communication would be considered a privileged communication if it were made between a client and an attorney.This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.Digest Key
