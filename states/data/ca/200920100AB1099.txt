						FullerFebruary 27, 2009 An act to amend Section 17315 Sections 17309, 17315, 81141, and 81147 of the Education Code, relating to school facilities. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1099, as amended, Fuller.
											  School facilities: construction.Existing law, the Field Act, requires the Department of General Services under the police power of the state to supervise the design and construction of a school building, as defined, or the reconstruction or alteration of, or addition to, a school building, if not exempted under specified law, to ensure that plans and specifications comply with adopted rules and regulations and building standards published in regulations, and to ensure that the work of construction is performed in accordance with the approved plans and specifications for the protection of life and property. As the work of construction or alteration progresses and when the department requires, the licensed architect or structural engineer in charge of observing construction or registered engineer in charge of
		observing other work, the inspector on the work, and the contractor are each required to submit reports, based on personal knowledge, as defined, to the department that the work and materials comply with the approved plans and specifications. When the construction is completed, notice of completion is filed, specified reports are submitted to the department, and all required fees are paid, the department is required to issue a certification that the school building complies with the requirements of the Field Act.This bill would eliminate the requirement that the contractor submit periodic reports to the department that the work and materials comply with the approved plans and specifications and would eliminate the requirement that notice of completion be filed before the department issues a certification that the school building complies with the Field Act
		requirements. The bill also would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to the above provision regarding
		certification of completion these provisions.Digest Key
