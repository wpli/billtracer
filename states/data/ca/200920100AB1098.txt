											  Natural resources: resource conservation: Chino Agricultural Preserve.The California Wildlife, Coastal, and Park Land Conservation Act (Proposition 70) provides funding from the sale of bonds for the acquisition, development, rehabilitation, protection, or restoration of park, wildlife, coastal, and natural lands in California.Existing law authorizes the County of San Bernardino to sell property it owns within the Chino Agricultural Preserve that was purchased with those bond funds, provided the county meets the conditions required under that act for the sale, and other specified conditions, including using all the proceeds from the sale only for the acquisition of replacement land within the Chino Agricultural Preserve.This bill would additionally authorize the County of San Bernardino to exchange property it owns within the Chino Agricultural Preserve that was purchased with those bond funds under the same conditions. The bill would revise one
		of those conditions to alternatively require the property received in an exchange and all the proceeds from a sale to be used for the improvement, operation, and maintenance of existing or replacement land within the Chino Agriculture Preserve.Digest Key
