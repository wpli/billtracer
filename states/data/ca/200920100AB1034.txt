											  County employees’ retirement.(1) Under existing law, counties and districts, as defined, may provide retirement benefits to their employees pursuant to the County Employees Retirement Law of 1937.This bill would include the retirement system established in Marin County within the definition of a “district” for purposes of providing retirement benefits to that system’s employees, subject to resolution by the board of retirement making that provision applicable to the county.(2) The County Employees Retirement Law of 1937 authorizes the board of retirement of Orange County to appoint specified management, investment, and legal personnel. These appointees are not classified as county employees and are therefore not subject to the civil service system, but are employees of that retirement system, subject to the terms of employment
		determined by the board of retirement. Existing law authorizes the board of retirement of San Bernardino County to adopt, by resolution, those provisions classifying specified personnel of their respective systems as employees of the retirement system.This bill would additionally authorize the board of retirement of Marin County to adopt these provisions by resolution, but would limit to specified management positions those personnel who may be classified as employees of the retirement system.Digest Key
