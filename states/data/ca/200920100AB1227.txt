						LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1227, Feuer.
											  Workers’ compensation: public employees: leaves of absence. Existing workers’ compensation law requires employers to secure the payment of workers’ compensation, including medical treatment, for injuries incurred by their employees that arise out of, and in the course of, employment.Existing law generally provides that whenever certain public employees who are members of the Public Employees’ Retirement System or the Los Angeles City Employees’ Retirement System or subject to the County Employees Retirement Law of 1937 are disabled, whether temporarily or permanently, by injury or illness arising out of, and in the course of, their duties, they are required to become entitled, regardless of their period of service with the public employer, to a leave of absence while so disabled without loss of salary in lieu of temporary disability payments or maintenance allowance payments, if any, that would be payable for the period of disability, but not exceeding one year, or until that
		earlier date as he or she is retired on permanent disability pension, and is actually receiving disability pension payment, or certain advanced disability pension payment.This bill would, for purposes of these provisions, require that these employees be employed on a regular, full-time basis, but would eliminate the requirement that these employees be members of the Public Employees’ Retirement System or the Los Angeles City Employees’ Retirement System or subject to the County Employees Retirement Law of 1937.The bill would provide that the provisions pertaining to a leave of absence shall not apply to certain public safety personnel who are employees of the City and County of San Francisco.Digest Key
