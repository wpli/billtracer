				  as an all-mailed ballot election pursuant to this section.(3) The election is not a special election to fill a vacancy in a state office, the Legislature, or Congress.(4) At least one polling place is provided in each city within the jurisdiction and is open to receive voted ballots for at least two weeks before the date of the election and until 8 p.m. on the day of the election.(5) The elections official delivers to each voter all supplies necessary for the use and return of the mail ballot, including an envelope for the return of the voted mail ballot, postage prepaid.(6) The elections official delivers to each voter, with either the sample ballot sent pursuant
				  to Section 13303 or with the voter’s ballot, a list of the polling places provided pursuant to paragraph (4), and this list is also posted on the Internet Web site of the county elections office.(7) The return of voted mail ballots is subject to Section 3017. (8) The polling places provided under this section are at an accessible location and are equipped with voting units or systems that are accessible to individuals with disabilities and that provide the same opportunity for access and participation, including the ability to vote privately and independently.(9) Elections pursuant to this section may be held on no more than three different dates in each county.(b) (1) If a county conducts an
