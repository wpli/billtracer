											  Parole: conditions. Inmates: incentive credits.Existing law provides time credit for work performance and good behavior to prisoners confined to a county jail, industrial farm, or road camp, or any city jail, industrial farm, or road camp. Specifically, except regarding certain prisoners who are limited to 15% credit against sentenced time, existing law provides that a term of 4 days will be deemed to have been served for every 2 days spent in actual custody in one of these facilities, except that a term of 6 days will be deemed to have been served for every 4 days in actual custody for prisoners required to register as sex offenders, prisoners committed for a serious felony, or prisoners with a prior conviction for a serious or violent felony.This bill would instead provide that prisoners sentenced to state prison, except for those required to register as sex offenders, committed for a
		serious felony, or with a previous conviction for a serious or violent felony, who are confined in a city or county jail, industrial farm, or road camp prior to and after the date of a sentence to state prison shall have one day deducted from his or her period of confinement for every day the prisoner served in a city or county jail, industrial farm, or road camp. The bill would provide that a prisoner sentenced to state prison who is confined in a city or county jail, industrial farm, or road camp may not receive the day for day credit if it appears by the record that the prisoner refused to satisfactorily perform labor or failed to satisfactorily comply with rules and regulations, as specified. The bill would provide that, for prisoners otherwise in a county jail, industrial farm, or road camp, or any city jail, industrial farm, or road camp, except those subject to the 15% limitation on credits noted above, a term of 6 days will be deemed to have been served for every 4 days spent in actual custody.
		Because this bill would change the punishment for crimes, it would impose a state-mandated local program.The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.Existing law authorizes the imposition of various conditions on persons released from prison on parole. Under existing law, one of the conditions imposed upon a prisoner released on parole is that the prisoner agree to be subject to search or seizure by a parole officer or other peace officer at any time of the day or night, with or without a search warrant and with or without cause. If the prisoner does not agree to that condition of release, he or she loses worktime credits earned and may not be released from prison until he or she agrees to that condition or the entire term of imprisonment has expired, as specified. This bill would, instead, require that any person being released on parole who was not committed to prison for a registerable sex offense, a serious felony, a violent felony, or any felony that directly or indirectly involved violence or the threat of violence, and who does not have a prior conviction for a serious or violent felony, be released on parole with only two conditions. Specifically, this bill would provide that an eligible parolee shall agree in writing to be subject to search or seizure and submit to random drug testing by a parole officer or other peace officer at any time of the day or night, with or without a search warrant and with or without cause. This bill would provide that any eligible inmate who does not agree in writing to those conditions shall lose worktime credit earned pursuant to specified provisions on a day-for-day basis and shall not be released until he or she either agrees in writing to these conditions or has no remaining worktime credit, whichever occurs first.Digest Key

                                NOYES  Bill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. Section 2933 of the Penal Code is amended to read:2933. (a) It is the intent of the Legislature that persons convicted of a crime and sentenced to the state prison under Section 1170 serve the entire sentence imposed by the court, except for a reduction in the time served in the custody of the Secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation pursuant to this section and Section 2933.05.(b) For every six months of continuous incarceration, a prisoner shall be awarded credit reductions from his or her term of confinement of six months. A lesser amount of credit based on this ratio shall be awarded for any lesser period of continuous incarceration. Credit should be awarded pursuant to regulations adopted by the secretary. Prisoners who are denied the opportunity to earn credits pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 2932 shall be awarded no credit reduction pursuant to this section.
				  Under no circumstances shall any prisoner receive more than six months’ credit reduction for any six-month period under this section.(c) Credit is a privilege, not a right. Credit must be earned and may be forfeited pursuant to the provisions of Section 2932. Except as provided in subdivision (a) of Section 2932, every eligible prisoner shall have a reasonable opportunity to participate.(d) Under regulations adopted by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, which shall require a period of not more than one year free of disciplinary infractions, credit which has been previously forfeited may be restored by the secretary. The regulations shall provide for separate classifications of serious disciplinary infractions as they relate to restoration of credits, the time period required before forfeited credits or a portion thereof may be restored, and the percentage of forfeited credits that may be restored for these time periods. For credits
				  forfeited as specified in paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 2932, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation may provide that up to 180 days of lost credit shall not be restored and up to 90 days of credit shall not be restored for a forfeiture resulting from conspiracy or attempts to commit one of those acts. No credits may be restored if they were forfeited for a serious disciplinary infraction in which the victim died or was permanently disabled. Upon application of the prisoner and following completion of the required time period free of disciplinary offenses, forfeited credits eligible for restoration under the regulations for disciplinary offenses other than serious disciplinary infractions punishable by a credit loss of more than 90 days shall be restored unless, at a hearing, it is found that the prisoner refused to accept or failed to perform in a credit qualifying assignment, or extraordinary circumstances are present that require that credits not be restored. “Extraordinary
				  circumstances” shall be defined in the regulations adopted by the secretary. However, in any case in which credit was forfeited for a serious disciplinary infraction punishable by a credit loss of more than 90 days, restoration of credit shall be at the discretion of the secretary.The prisoner may appeal the finding through the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation’s review procedure, which shall include a review by an individual independent of the institution who has supervisorial authority over the institution.(e)A prisoner sentenced to the state prison under Section 1170 shall receive one day of credit for every day served in a county jail, city jail, industrial farm, or road camp after the date he or she was sentenced to the state prison as specified in subdivision (f) of Section 4019. (e) (1) Notwithstanding Section 4019, a prisoner sentenced to the state prison under Section 1170 shall have one day deducted from his or her period of confinement for every day he or she served in a county jail, city jail, industrial farm, or road camp prior to and after the date he or she was sentenced to a state prison term for which imposition or execution is not suspended.(2) A prisoner may not receive the credit specified in paragraph (1) if it appears by the record that the prisoner has refused to satisfactorily perform labor as assigned by, or has not satisfactorily complied with the reasonable rules and regulations established by the sheriff, chief of police, or superintendent of an industrial farm or road camp.(3) Section 4019, and not this subdivision, shall apply if the prisoner is required to register as a sex offender, pursuant to Chapter 5.5 (commencing with Section 290), was committed for
