						PriceJanuary 12, 2009 An act to amend Sections 2102, 2142, 2150, 2162, and 2194 of, and to add Section 2101.5 to, the Elections Code, to amend Section 6254.4 of the Government Code, to add Section 19584.5 to the Revenue and Taxation Code, and to amend Section 12950.5 of, and to add Section 12500.5 to, the Vehicle Code, relating to elections. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 106, as amended, Price.
											  Elections: voter registration.Under existing law, a person may register to vote by completing an affidavit of registration.This bill would also provide that a person may register to vote by completing and submitting to the Department of Motor Vehicles a voter form on an application for a new or renewed California driver’s license, instruction permit, junior permit, or identification card, or by completing and submitting to the Franchise Tax Board a voter form on a Personal Income Tax form. If the person named on these voter forms would not be 18 years of age at the time of the next election but otherwise satisfies the requirements to be registered to vote, he or she would be automatically registered to vote at 18 years of age. The bill would require the Department of Motor Vehicles and the Franchise Tax Board to transmit these voter forms to the elections official of the county in which the person resides, unless the person has not indicated that he
		or she wishes to be registered to vote, has not completed the application or form, or has not supplied sufficient information to indicate that he or she satisfies the requirements to be registered to vote. Except as specified, these voter forms would be affidavits of registration.Because the bill requires elections officials to perform additional duties, it would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.Digest Key
