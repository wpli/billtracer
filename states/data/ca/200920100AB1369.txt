						DavisFebruary 27, 2009 An act to amend, repeal, and add Sections 1208.2, 2900.5, and 4532 of, and to add and repeal Sections 1203.018, 1203.019, and 1269d of, the Penal Code, relating to electronic monitoring. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1369, Davis.
											  Inmates: electronic monitoring.Existing law provides that the board of supervisors of any county may authorize the correctional administrator to offer a program under which minimum security inmates and low-risk offenders committed to a county jail or other county correctional facility or granted probation, or inmates participating in a work furlough program, may voluntarily participate in a home detention program. Existing law also provides that the board of supervisors of any county may, upon determination by the correctional administrator that conditions in a jail facility warrant the necessity of releasing sentenced misdemeanor inmates prior to them serving the full amount of a given sentence due to lack of jail space, offer a program under which specified inmates may be required to participate in an involuntary home detention program.This bill would provide that, until January 1, 2015, upon determination of the correctional administrator that
		conditions in a jail facility warrant the necessity of releasing inmates being held in lieu of bail, the board of supervisors of any county may authorize the correctional administrator to offer a program under which these inmates may be placed in an electronic monitoring program, as specified. The bill would provide separate authority for voluntary and involuntary electronic monitoring programs. The bill would establish criteria for inmates to be eligible for programs established pursuant to its provisions and would specify circumstances under which inmates may be placed in these programs. The bill would also provide that defendants arrested for a bailable offense who are without any other warrant and who meet certain criteria may apply, after 10 court days from the date of arraignment, for release on reduced bail if the defendant agrees to be placed in the voluntary electronic monitoring program and the court and correctional administrator determine that the defendant is eligible to participate in the
		electronic monitoring program. The bill would make it a misdemeanor for any inmate who is a participant in an electronic monitoring program to fail to comply with the prescribed rules and regulations. By creating a new crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would specify, for persons pending disposition of charges, that electronic monitoring programs authorized pursuant to this bill include, but are not limited to, home detention programs, work furlough programs, and work release programs. The bill would make other conforming changes.Existing law provides for an administrative fee for specified work furlough and voluntary electronic home detention program participants.This bill would include participants in the voluntary electronic monitoring program for persons pending disposition of charges, and the existing voluntary home detention program, within the coverage of those administrative fee
		provisions, as specified.This bill would incorporate changes to Section 4532 of the Penal Code made by SB 1266, contingent on the prior enactment of that bill.The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.Digest Key

				  county correctional facility may voluntarily participate in an electronic monitoring program if the conditions specified in subdivision (a) are met.(c) (1) In order to qualify for participation in an electronic monitoring program pursuant to this section, the inmate must be a minimum security inmate with no holds or outstanding warrants and one of the following circumstances must exist:(A) A magistrate has approved the electronic monitoring release pursuant to Section 1269d.(B) The inmate has been held in custody for at least 30 calendar days from the date of arraignment pending disposition of only misdemeanor charges.(C) The inmate has been held in custody pending disposition of charges for at least 60 calendar days from the
				  date of arraignment.(2) All participants shall be subject to discretionary review by the correctional administrator consistent with this section.(d) The county board of supervisors, after consulting with the sheriff and district attorney, may prescribe reasonable rules and regulations under which an electronic monitoring program pursuant to this section may operate. As a condition of participation in the electronic monitoring program, the participant shall give his or her consent in writing to participate and shall agree in writing to comply with the rules and regulations of the program, including, but not limited to, all of the following:(1) The participant shall remain within the interior premises of his or her residence during the hours designated by the correctional administrator.(2) The participant shall admit any person or agent designated by the correctional administrator into his or her residence at any time for purposes of verifying the participant’s compliance with the conditions of his or her detention.(3) If released pursuant to subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (c), the participant shall post bond prior to being placed on electronic monitoring.(4) The electronic monitoring may include global positioning system devices or other supervising devices for the purpose of helping to verify the participant’s compliance with the rules and regulations of the electronic detention program. The devices shall not be used to eavesdrop or record any conversation, except a conversation between the participant and the person supervising the participant to be used solely for the purposes
				  of voice identification.(5) The correctional administrator in charge of the county correctional facility from which the participant was released may, without further order of the court, immediately retake the person into custody if the electronic monitoring or supervising devices are unable for any reason to properly perform their function at the designated place of home detention, if the person fails to remain within the place of home detention as stipulated in the agreement, if the person willfully fails to pay fees to the provider of electronic home detention services, as stipulated in the agreement, subsequent to the written notification of the participant that the payment has not been received and that return to custody may result, or if the person for any other reason no longer meets the established criteria under this section.A copy of the signed consent to participate and a copy of the
				  agreement to comply with the rules and regulations shall be provided to the participant and a copy shall be retained by the correctional administrator.(e) The rules and regulations and administrative policy of the program shall be reviewed on an annual basis by the county board of supervisors and the correctional administrator. The rules and regulations shall be given to every participant.(f) Whenever the peace officer supervising a participant has reasonable cause to believe that the participant is not complying with the rules or conditions of the program, or that the electronic monitoring devices are unable to function properly in the designated place of confinement, the peace officer may, under general or specific authorization of the correctional administrator, and without a warrant of arrest, retake the person into custody.(g) (1) Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the correctional administrator to allow a person to participate in this program if it appears from the record that the person has not satisfactorily complied with reasonable rules and regulations while in custody. A person shall be eligible for participation in an electronic monitoring program only if the correctional administrator concludes that the person meets the criteria for release established under this section and that the person’s participation is consistent with any reasonable rules and regulations prescribed by the board of supervisors or the administrative policy of the correctional administrator.(2) The correctional administrator, or his or her designee, shall have discretionary authority consistent with this section to permit program participation as an alternative to physical custody.

				  detention are punishable as provided in subdivision (c) of Section 4532.(i) The board of supervisors may prescribe a program administrative fee to be paid by each electronic monitoring participant.(j) For purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:(1) “Correctional administrator” means the sheriff, probation officer, or director of the county department of corrections.(2) “Electronic monitoring program” includes, but is not limited to, home detention programs, work furlough programs, and work release programs.(3) “Minimum security inmate” means an inmate who, by established local classification criteria, would be eligible for placement in a Type IV local
				  detention facility, as described in Title 15 of the California Code of Regulations.(k) Notwithstanding any other law, upon request of a local law enforcement agency with jurisdiction over the location where a participant in an electronic monitoring program is placed, the correctional administrator shall provide the following information regarding participants in the electronic monitoring program:(1) The participant’s name, address, and date of birth.(2) The offense or offenses alleged to have been committed by the participant.(3) The period of time the participant will be placed on home detention.(4) Whether the participant successfully completed the prescribed period of home
				  detention or was returned to a county correctional facility, and if the person was returned to a county correctional facility, the reason for the return.(5) The gender and ethnicity of the participant.(6) If released pursuant to Section 1269d, the name, address, and contact information of any bail agent or surety.(l) Any information received by a law enforcement agency pursuant to subdivision (k) shall be used only for the purpose of monitoring the impact of home electronic monitoring programs on the community.(m) It is the intent of the Legislature that electronic monitoring programs established under this section maintain the highest public confidence, credibility, and public safety.
