						Wiggins)February 27, 2009An act to add Section 44257.3 to the Education Code, relating to linked learning.LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1223, Block.
											  Linked learning.Existing law authorizes the Commission on Teacher Credentialing to issue various types of teaching credentials and authorizations. Existing law establishes multiple pathway programs, which are multiyear comprehensive high school programs of integrated academic and technical study that are organized around a broad theme, interest area, or industry sector. Multiple pathway programs are comprised, among other things, of an integrated core curriculum that meets the eligibility requirements for admission to the University of California and the California State University and is delivered through project-based learning and other engaging instructional strategies that intentionally bring real-world context and relevance to the curriculum where broad themes, interest areas, and career technical education are emphasized.This bill would define “linked learning programs,” and would authorize the commission to convene a workgroup
		consisting of specified members to develop program standards for the issuance of a recognition of study in linked learning, as defined, for linked learning competence for holders of a single subject teaching credential who will be teaching pupils enrolled in linked learning programs, as specified. The bill would authorize the commission to work with the Superintendent of Public Instruction to gather and post, on an appropriate Internet Web site, best practices from school districts and schools on curriculum development and professional development relating to implementing and sustaining multiple pathway programs.Digest Key

		  and career technical coursework, and both should be promoted. When linked and delivered in ways that mutually reinforce one another, both academic and career technical courses are strengthened.(e) All pupils should have equal access to schools and programs that offer linked coursework. Pupils need a range of educational experiences to prepare them for success beyond high school.(f) A foundation of academic knowledge, general workplace competencies, and occupationally specific knowledge and skills enable pupils to better access all postsecondary options.(g) Pupil learning is enhanced when pupils are enrolled in courses that use hands-on experiential learning to exemplify how academic knowledge is used to solve real-world problems.(h) It is the intent

A recognition of study in linked learning teacher preparation program may be offered as part of an initial teacher preparation program or as a separate program for previously credentialed teachers.(2) “Linked learning programs” are programs and pathways described in
				  Section 52372.5 and may include, but are not limited to, California partnership academies.(b) The commission may convene a workgroup to develop program standards for the issuance of a recognition of study for linked learning competence for holders of a single subject teaching credential who will be teaching pupils enrolled in linked learning programs pursuant to Section 52372.5.(c) Members of the workgroup shall include, but are not limited to, representatives from:(1) The department.(2) Approved teacher preparation programs, including at least one representative from the California State University, the University of California, and independent institutions of higher education.

				  interest or prior experience in preparing teachers to teach in linked learning programs.(3) The business community, including representatives from local chambers of commerce.(4) School districts, county offices of education, and charter schools that have implemented linked learning programs, California partnership academies, or other similar programs that integrate core academic subject and industry applications.(5) Regional occupational centers and programs.(6) Practicing career technical education teachers.(7) Other organizations as deemed appropriate by the commission.(d) It is the intent of the Legislature that a
				  successful candidate for a recognition of study developed pursuant to subdivision (b) demonstrate appropriate knowledge, as determined by the commission based upon the recommendations of the workgroup convened pursuant to subdivision (b). Within the context of the academic content standards in kindergarten and any of grades 1 to 12, inclusive, this knowledge may include, but is not limited to, an understanding of the following:(1) How to develop and maintain industry and postsecondary educational partnerships.(2) Ongoing professional learning.(3) Work-based learning strategies.(4) Career exposure and development.(5) Interdisciplinary collaboration and project-based teaching
				  methods.(6) California Career Technical Education Model Curriculum Standards adopted by the State Board of Education.(e) With respect to any recognition of study for linked learning issued pursuant to subdivision (b), the California State University and other teacher preparation institutions are encouraged to establish goals for increasing the number of teachers prepared through linked learning programs.(f) Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment programs are encouraged to provide appropriate support, mentoring, and assistance to beginning teachers who are teaching in linked learning programs, including candidates who are in externships.(g) The commission may work with the Superintendent to gather and post, on an appropriate Internet Web site, best
				  practices from school districts and schools on curriculum development and professional development relating to implementing and sustaining multiple pathway programs.(h) The holder of a single-subject teaching credential receiving a recognition of study in linked learning pursuant to subdivision (b) is not authorized to teach subject matter content or English learners unless he or she holds an appropriate authorization or is employed on the basis of a legal assignment option.
