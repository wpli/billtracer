											  Peace officer training. Income and corporation tax credits: research and development.The Personal Income Tax Law and the Corporation Tax Law, by reference to a specified federal statute, allow a credit against taxes imposed by those laws for increasing research expenses, as defined. In general, the amount of the credit under both laws is equal to 15% of the excess of the qualified research expenses, as defined, for the taxable year over the base amount, as defined, and, in addition, for purposes of the Corporation Tax Law, 24% of the basic research payments, as defined. The term “base amount” means the product of the average annual gross receipts of the taxpayer for each of the specified years preceding the taxable year and the fixed-base percentage, as defined, but in no event less than 50% of the qualified research expenses for the taxable year. A taxpayer may elect an alternative incremental credit for increasing research expenses in modified conformity to federal
		income tax laws.This bill would increase the credit for increasing research expenses to 20% of the excess of the qualified research expenses. This bill would also provide complete conformity to the alternative incremental credit provided under those federal income tax laws.This bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy.Existing law directs the Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training to establish training standards and develop a course of instruction involving the responsibilities of first responders to terrorism incidents, as specified.This bill would make a technical, nonsubstantive change to these provisions.Digest Key
