						LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1343, Huffman.
											  Solid waste: architectural paint: recovery program.Existing law prohibits the disposal of latex paint in the land or waters of the state and authorizes certain persons to accept latex paint for recycling.The California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989, administered by the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, is required to reduce, recycle, and reuse solid waste generated in the state to the maximum extent feasible in an efficient cost-effective manner to conserve water, energy, and other natural resources.This bill would create an architectural paint recovery program that would be enforced by the
		department. On or before April 1, 2012, a manufacturer or designated stewardship organization would be required to submit to the department an architectural paint stewardship plan to develop and implement a recovery program to reduce the generation of postconsumer paint, promote the reuse of postconsumer architectural paint, and manage the end-of-life of postconsumer architectural paint, in an environmentally sound fashion, including collection, transportation, processing, and disposal. The plan would be required to contain specified elements of an architectural paint stewardship
		program, including, but not limited to, an architectural paint stewardship assessment, approved by the
		department, on each container of architectural paint sold in this state. The bill would require the plan to be reviewed and approved by the department within 90 days of receipt.This bill would require, on or before July 1,
		2012, or 3 months after a plan is approved by the department, the manufacturer or stewardship organization to implement the architectural paint stewardship program described in the approved plan.The bill would also prohibit a manufacturer or retailer from selling or offering for sale architectural paint to any person in this state, unless the manufacturer is listed on the department’s Internet Web site as being in compliance with
		the bill’s requirements. The prohibition would be in effect on the 120th day after a notice listing the manufacturers that are in compliance is posted on the department’s Internet Web site
		and would remain in effect with regard to a noncompliant manufacturer until that manufacturer is listed on the department’s Internet Web site or can otherwise demonstrate compliance, as prescribed.This bill would authorize the department to administratively impose civil penalties for violations of the act.The bill would also require a stewardship organization to pay the department annual administrative fees in the amount that is sufficient to cover the
		department’s full costs of administering and enforcing the program.The bill would establish the Paint Recovery Account in the Integrated Waste Management Fund, would require the fees to be deposited in this account, and would require the department to expend those fees, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to cover the department’s costs to implement the bill’s provisions. The bill would also establish the Paint Recovery Penalty Subaccount in the Integrated Waste Management Fund, would require the penalties collected to be deposited in that subaccount, and would authorize the department to expend those funds, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to cover the department’s costs to implement the bill’s provisions.
		The bill would require manufacturers to submit a report to the
		department by July 1, 2013, and each year thereafter, describing their paint recovery efforts.The bill would provide that certain actions taken pursuant to the program established by the bill do not violate the Cartwright Act or the Unfair Practices Act.Digest Key

                                NO  Bill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:(a) Architectural paint is a priority waste type based on its high volume, subsequent cost to manage, and high potential for increased recovery, reuse, and recycling.(b) The Department of Toxic Substances Control has deemed latex paint as presumed hazardous in California and oil-based paint is characteristically hazardous, making both latex and oil-based paints prohibited from disposal in California. (c) The former California Integrated Waste Management Board estimated that architectural paint, both latex and oil-based, comprises the largest volume of waste product collected at publicly operated household hazardous waste facilities, 35 percent of total household hazardous waste collected in California in the 2007–08 fiscal year.(d) The Department of Toxic Substances Control estimates that the cost to manage waste architectural paint in California is the single largest cost to local governments in the household hazardous waste system.(e) The
		  former board estimated that for the 2007–08 fiscal year only 5 percent of California households utilized a household hazardous waste program.(f) Architectural paint is convenient to buy and inconvenient to recycle or legally dispose of in California.(g) There has been an ongoing debate on how to better manage leftover architectural paint since 1989 when the board heard an item on options to fund a collection and management system.(h) A national dialogue has been ongoing since 2002, yet has not resulted in any architectural paint collection or financial relief to California local governments.(i) California has the largest number of latex paint recyclers in the country: Amazon Environmental (Riverside), Kelly-Moore
		  (Sacramento), and Visions (Sacramento).(j) State procurement of recycled paint is required. The state agency “buy recycled” mandates are not being met, and there is no enforcement mechanism, resulting in only 2 percent compliance reporting to the board.SEC. 2. Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 48700) is added to Part 7 of Division 30 of the Public Resources Code, to read:

					 program with existing local household hazardous waste collection programs as much as this is reasonably feasible and is mutually agreeable between those programs.(d) The plan shall include goals established by the manufacturer or stewardship organization to reduce the generation of postconsumer paint, to promote the reuse of postconsumer paint, and for the proper end-of-life management of postconsumer paint, including recovery and recycling of postconsumer paint, as practical, based on current household hazardous waste program information. The goals may be revised by the manufacturer or stewardship organization based on the information collected for the annual report.(e) The plan shall include consumer, contractor, and retailer education and outreach efforts to promote the source reduction and recycling of architectural paint. This information may include, but is not limited to,
					 developing, and updating as necessary, educational and other outreach materials aimed at retailers of architectural paint. These materials shall be made available to the retailers.
