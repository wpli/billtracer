						MillerFebruary 27, 2009An act to amend Section 25258 of the Vehicle Code, relating to vehicles.LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1385, Miller.
											  Vehicles: authorized emergency vehicles: blue warning lights.Existing law allows an authorized emergency vehicle used by a peace officer, as defined, in the performance of his or her duties to display a steady or flashing blue warning light visible from the front, sides, or rear of the vehicle.This bill would expand the definition of peace officer for purposes of that provision to include members of an arson-investigating unit, regularly paid and employed in that capacity, of a fire department or fire protection
		agency of a county, city, city and county, district, or the state, if the primary duty of these peace officers is the detection and apprehension of persons who have violated any fire law or committed insurance fraud.The bill would also limit the authorization to display a steady or flashing blue warning light to authorized emergency vehicles used by peace officers in accordance with the above provisions.Digest Key
