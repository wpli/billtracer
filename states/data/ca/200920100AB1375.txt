						GalgianiFebruary 27, 2009 An act to repeal and add Division 19.5 (commencing with Section 185000) amend Section 185024 of the Public Utilities Code, relating to high-speed rail. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1375, as amended, Galgiani.
											  High-speed rail.Existing law, the California High-Speed Train Act, creates the High-Speed Rail Authority to develop and implement a high-speed train system in the state, with specified powers and duties. Existing law, the Safe, Reliable High-Speed Passenger Train Bond Act for the 21st Century, approved by the voters as Proposition 1A at the November 4, 2008, general election, provides for the issuance of $9.95 billion in general obligation bonds for high-speed rail and related purposes.Existing law provides for appointment of an executive director by the authority, who is exempt from civil service and serves at the pleasure of the authority.This bill, for purposes of managing and administering the ongoing work of the authority in implementing the high-speed train project, would authorize the Governor, upon the
		recommendation of the executive director, to appoint up to 6 additional authority employees, exempt from civil service, who would serve in specified positions at the pleasure of the executive director. The bill would require a salary survey to be conducted to determine the maximum compensation for the executive director and additional exempt employees, and would require the salaries to be approved by the Department of Personnel Administration.This bill would revise and recast these provisions by repealing and reenacting the California High-Speed Train Act. The bill would continue the High-Speed Rail Authority in existence to establish compensation of certain employees of the department, advise the Secretary of Business, Transportation and Housing and the Director of the Department of Railroads concerning high-speed rail matters, and annually adopt a 6-year high-speed train program for
		submission to the Governor and the Legislature. The bill would create the Department of Railroads within the Business, Transportation and Housing Agency, which would succeed to most of the existing powers and responsibilities of the authority and would be responsible for implementing the high-speed train project. The director of the department would be appointed by the Governor, who would serve at the pleasure of the Governor, and the Governor would be authorized to appoint up to 10 executive employees of the department who would be exempt from civil service and serve at the pleasure of the director. The bill would provide for acquisition and disposition by the department of rights-of-way for the high-speed rail project. The bill would limit the department’s authority to use eminent domain to the powers previously granted to the authority in that regard, as specified. The bill would transfer the
		existing employees of the authority, other than the executive director, to the department. The bill would enact other related provisions.Digest Key
