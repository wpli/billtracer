An act to add Section 5080.42 to the Public Resources Code, relating to state parks, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately.LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 135, as amended, Jeffries.
											  Public resources: forest protection: urban forestry: cost sharing. State parks: California Citrus State Historic Park: operating agreement.Existing law authorizes the Department of Parks and Recreation to enter into an agreement with an agency of the United States, a city, county, district, or public agency, or any combination thereof, for the care, maintenance, administration, and control of lands of the state park system.This bill would require the department to enter into an operating agreement with the City of Riverside for the development, improvement, restoration, care, maintenance, administration, and control of California Citrus State Historic Park. The bill would require that the agreement contain certain provisions. The bill would also provide that, notwithstanding the existence of the operating agreement, the park shall be eligible for any grants or funding
		for which the park was eligible prior to the agreement.This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.(1)Existing law, the Wildland Fire Protection Management Act of 1978, authorizes the Director of Forestry and Fire Protection to enter into contracts, with the approval of the Director of General Services, for prescribed burning or other hazardous fuel reduction with the owner or any person who has legal control of any property or any public agency with regulatory or natural resource management authority over certain lands. The act authorizes the state to assume a proportionate share of the costs of site preparation and prescribed burning or other hazardousfuel reduction.This bill would change the term “contract” to “agreement” and would delete the requirement of approval by the Director of General Services. The bill would also authorize the director to accept grants and donations of equipment, materials, or funds from any source for the purpose of supporting or facilitating the prescribed burning or other hazardous fuels reduction work. The director would be authorized to waive the cost sharing requirements of the act where the funding source prohibits cost sharing requirements.(2)Existing law authorizes the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection to enter into agreements and make loans to encourage private and public investment in, and improved management of, forest lands and resources within the state to ensure adequate future high-quality timber supplies, related employment and other economic benefits, and the protection, maintenance, and enhancement of a productive and stable forest resource system for the benefit of present and future generations. The Director of Forestry and Fire Protection is authorized to enter into agreements for forest resource improvement work with eligible landowners that require cost sharing on the part of the landowner and is required to deposit into the Forest Resource Improvement Fund funds from any source for forest resource improvement purposes.This bill would allow the department to waive the cost sharing requirement when the funding source for the authorized forest resource improvement work prohibits cost sharing requirements. The bill would exempt funds received pursuant to the federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 from a requirement that those funds be deposited into the Forest Resources Improvement Fund.(3)Existing law, the California Urban Forestry Act of 1978, authorizes the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection to implement a program in urban forestry to, among other things, encourage better management and planting of trees in urban areas and assist cities in innovative solutions to problems, including greenhouse gas emissions, urban heat island effect, stormwater management, lack of green space, and vandalism. The director, with advice from other appropriate state agencies and interested parties, is authorized to make grants to provide assistance of 25 to 90% of costs for projects meeting guidelines established by the State Board of Forestry and Fire Protection, upon recommendation by the director.This bill would allow the director to waive the cost sharing requirement when the funding source for a grant prohibits cost sharing requirements.(4)This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.Digest Key

		  conjunction with the city’s museum department.(g) The city is confident that California Citrus State Historic Park will become an even more significant regional attraction under the city’s stewardship.

				  a charge for general admission to the park.(b) Notwithstanding the existence of the operating agreement, the park shall be eligible for any grants or funding for which the park was eligible prior to the agreement.SEC. 3. This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect.
