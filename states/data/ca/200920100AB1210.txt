											  Health care service plans.Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care. Existing law requires health care service plans to meet certain requirements, including, but not limited to, having the organizational and administrative capacity to provide services to subscribers and enrollees and providing basic health care services, as defined, to those subscribers and enrollees.This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to that provision.Digest Key

Facilities not located in this state shall conform to all licensing and other requirements of the jurisdiction in which they are located.(b)  Personnel employed by or under contract to the plan shall be licensed or certified by their
				  respective board or agency, where licensure or certification is required by law.(c)  Equipment required to be licensed or registered by law shall be so licensed or registered, and the operating personnel for that equipment shall be licensed or certified as required by law.(d)  The plan shall furnish services in a manner providing continuity of care and ready referral of patients to other providers at times as may be appropriate, consistent with good professional practice.(e)  (1)  All services shall be readily available at reasonable times to each enrollee consistent with good professional practice. To the extent feasible, the plan shall make all services readily accessible to all enrollees consistent with Section 1367.03.(2)  To the extent that telemedicine services
				  are appropriately provided through telemedicine, as defined in subdivision (a) of Section 2290.5 of the Business and Professions Code, these services shall be considered in determining compliance with Section 1300.67.2 of Title 28 of the California Code of Regulations.(3)  The plan shall make all services accessible and appropriate consistent with Section 1367.04.(f)  The plan shall employ and utilize allied health manpower for the furnishing of services to the extent permitted by law and consistent with good medical practice.(g)  The plan shall have the organizational and administrative capacity to provide services to subscribers and enrollees. The plan shall be able to demonstrate to the department that medical decisions are rendered by qualified medical providers, unhindered by fiscal and administrative management.(h)  (1)  Contracts with subscribers and enrollees,
				  including group contracts, and contracts with providers, and other persons furnishing services, equipment, or facilities to or in connection with the plan, shall be fair, reasonable, and consistent with the objectives of this chapter. All contracts with providers shall contain provisions requiring a fast, fair, and cost-effective dispute resolution mechanism under which providers may submit disputes to the plan, and requiring the plan to inform its providers upon contracting with the plan, or upon change to these provisions, of the procedures for processing and resolving disputes, including the location and telephone number where information regarding disputes may be submitted.(2)  A health care service plan shall ensure that a dispute resolution mechanism is accessible to noncontracting providers for the purpose of resolving billing and claims disputes.(3)  On and after January 1, 2002, a health care service plan shall annually submit a report to the
				  department regarding its dispute resolution mechanism. The report shall include information on the number of providers who utilized the dispute resolution mechanism and a summary of the disposition of those disputes.(i)  A health care service plan contract shall provide to subscribers and enrollees all of the basic health care services included in subdivision (b) of Section 1345, except that the director may, for good cause, by rule or order exempt a plan contract or any class of plan contracts from that requirement. The director shall by rule define the scope of each basic health care service that health care service plans are required to provide as a minimum for licensure under this chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit a health care service plan from charging subscribers or enrollees a copayment or a deductible for a basic health care service or from setting forth, by contract, limitations on maximum coverage of basic health care services, provided that the
				  copayments, deductibles, or limitations are reported to, and held unobjectionable by, the director and set forth to the subscriber or enrollee pursuant to the disclosure provisions of Section 1363.(j)  A health care service plan shall not require registration under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. Sec. 801 et seq.) as a condition for participation by an optometrist certified to use therapeutic pharmaceutical agents pursuant to Section 3041.3 of the Business and Professions Code.Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit the director to establish the rates charged subscribers and enrollees for contractual health care services.The director’s enforcement of Article 3.1 (commencing with Section 1357) shall not be deemed to establish the rates charged subscribers and enrollees for contractual health care services.The obligation of the plan to comply with this section shall not be waived when the plan delegates any services that it is
				  required to perform to its medical groups, independent practice associations, or other contracting entities.
