An act to amend Section 2107 of, and to add Article 4.5 (commencing with Section 2170) to Chapter 2 of Division 2 of, the Elections Code, relating to elections.LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1531, as amended, Portantino.
											  Elections: voter registration.Voter registration: one-stop voting.Existing law establishes procedures regarding the registration of voters. Under existing law, a person may not be registered to vote except by affidavit of registration, and a voter may not vote in an election unless his or her affidavit of registration is executed and received by the county elections official on or before the 15th day prior to the election. Existing law permits any registered voter to vote by a vote by mail ballot, and further permits any voter using a vote by mail ballot to vote the ballot at the office of the elections official beginning 29 days before the election.This bill would establish one-stop voting whereby a person would be permitted to register to vote and immediately vote on election day or at any time prior to election day when ballots may be cast. The bill would require a voter, in order to register and vote by
		means of one-stop voting, to visit a location at which one-stop voting is available, to present proof of identity and current residence, as specified, and to complete an affidavit of registration. Upon completing that registration, the voter would be immediately eligible to vote by regular ballot. If the voter is unable to complete that registration because the voter is unable to present proof of identity or proof of current residence, the voter would be permitted to register and vote by provisional ballot.The bill would require each county elections official to compile an index of voters who register to vote by one-stop voting. After the official canvass of the votes for that election is completed, the elections official would be required to review the names on the index and cancel duplicate registrations. The elections official would be required to send a voter registration form to every person who properly registered to vote by one-stop voting, and those persons
		would be registered for future elections at the address that the voter declared for purposes of voter registration. The elections official would be required to notify the district attorney and the Secretary of State if it appears that a person has engaged in fraudulent voting.The bill would require that one-stop voting be available at every permanent office of a county elections official beginning January 1 of the year following the availability of VoteCal.In addition, the bill would require that each location at which one-stop voting is available have a separate area for the process and have at least one precinct board member who is trained in one-stop voting. The bill would authorize the Secretary of State to adopt appropriate regulations to implement one-stop registration and voting.By creating new duties for local elections officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated
		local program.The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.Existing law prohibits a person from registering to vote except by affidavit of registration and requires that the affidavit be received by the county elections official no later than 15 days prior to the election, with specified exceptions. Under existing law, a person registered as a voter in any precinct in the state who moves from the district within 14 days prior to election day is, for the purpose of that election, entitled to vote in the precinct from which the person moved until the close of the polls on election day.This bill would authorize a person who qualifies to vote in the state to register or reregister at the office of the local elections official commencing 14 days prior to election day and continuing through election day or at the person’s precinct on election day. A person who registers to vote prior to election day and
		provides proof of current residence would be permitted to cast a vote by mail ballot. A person who registers to vote on election day would be permitted to cast a provisional ballot.The bill would also require local elections officials to compile a list or index of voters who registered or reregistered to vote pursuant to these provisions and to conduct a review no later than 30 days after the canvass of the votes for the election. By increasing the duties of local elections officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.The bill also would make conforming changes to provisions relating to provisional ballots.The bill would make its provisions operative on January 1, 2012.The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.Digest Key

While 82 percent of those provisional ballots were ultimately counted, the county investment of staff
		  overtime and resources to process these ballots was enormous. At the same time, a significant portion of the provisional ballots that were not counted resulted from the failure to timely register. One-stop registration and voting would help alleviate the staff overtime costs associated with processing numerous provisional ballots for counties.(d) One-stop voting, without unnecessary steps, can significantly increase turnout. The nine states that have enacted one-stop voting lead the nation in voter turnout.(e) The more people vote, the more clearly the public’s voice is heard.(f) California’s registration procedures have not kept up with available technology to maximize the efficiency of the voting process.(g) It is vital that California make every effort to maintain the integrity of our democracy by ensuring that every eligible voter may vote on election day.SEC. 2. Section 2107 of the Elections Code is amended to read:2107. (a) Except as provided in subdivision (b), the The county elections official shall accept affidavits of registration at all times except during the 14 days immediately preceding any election, when registration shall cease for that election as to electors residing in the territory within which the election is to be held.

				  before the close of the polls on election day.(b) The county elections official shall accept an affidavit of registration executed as part of a voter registration card in the forthcoming election if the affidavit is executed on or before the 15th day prior to the election, and if any of the following apply:(1) The A mailed affidavit is postmarked on or before the 15th day prior to the election and received by mail by the county elections official before the close of the polls on election day.(2) The
				  affidavit is submitted to the Department of Motor Vehicles or accepted by any other public agency designated as a voter registration agency pursuant to the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. Sec. 1973gg) not later than the 15th day prior to the election.(3) The affidavit is delivered to the county elections official by means other than those described in paragraphs (1) and (2) and (3) on or before the  15th day prior to the election
				  close of the polls on election day.(c) The county elections official shall accept an affidavit of registration that meets the requirements of Article 4.5 (commencing with Section 2170).SEC. 3. Article 4.5 (commencing with Section 2170) is added to Chapter 2 of Division 2 of the Elections Code, to read:
