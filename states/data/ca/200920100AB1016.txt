				  the Department of General Services shall distribute the following to all state agencies and departments:(1) A list of those commodities with the lowest life cycle costs, as determined pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (b).(2) The method or methods used by the Department of General Services to determine the life cycle costs of commodities.(d) The method or methods used by the Department of General Services to calculate the life cycle costs of commodities shall be designed to be easily understood and used by purchasing agents and other personnel in making purchasing decisions.(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all state agencies and departments shall purchase those commodities identified pursuant to subdivision (b) that have the
				  lowest life cycle costs and that meet the applicable specifications, and shall make every reasonable effort to identify and purchase other commodities with the lowest life cycle costs.(f) “Life cycle cost” for the purposes of this section, means the total cost of purchasing, installing, maintaining, and operating a device or system during its reasonably expected life. It includes, but is not necessarily limited to, capital costs, labor costs, energy costs, and operating and maintenance costs.SEC. 26. Section 16366.1 of the Government
		  Code is repealed.16366.1.The Legislature hereby finds and declares all of the following:(a)The federal government is proposing significant and fundamental changes in the structure and funding of social services by eliminating or greatly reducing many categorical grants and consolidating them into block grants to be administered by the state.(b)There has been little public debate or discussion on the proposed funding cuts which will result in significant cuts in programs which currently provide jobs, income, food, and medical care to poor people.(c)There currently exist no state statutes, consistent with federal statutes, for establishing need or directing the allocation of resources to categories of client populations to be affected by block grant efforts, and the state must act to so provide immediately.(d)The uncertainty surrounding the substance of the block grant proposals and the proximity of the 1981–82 federal fiscal year does not allow the state the time necessary to develop fair and effective service alternatives without serious disruptions of vital services currently being offered to our needy residents.(e)In order to serve the unique needs of California’s poor people, the state should continue, for the current year, to offer the services presently provided under federal categorical program grants.(f)The Legislature must thoroughly review the use of federal funds affecting special population “categorical” groups in the State of California because of its commitment to maintain the efficient delivery of vital services to the most needy persons in the state.(g)It is the intent of the Legislature that any provision of this article which is inconsistent with federal law shall not be operative.SEC. 27. Section 16366.1 is added to the
		  Government Code, to read:16366.1. The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:(a) For over 30 years, the federal government has funded programs that help low-income households meet the rising costs of utilities, including electricity, gas, and other household fuels, through block grants and other targeted funding that lowers the energy burden and increases the energy-related health and safety of low-income housing.(b) In California, it is calculated that low-income families spend up to 16 percent of their household income on utilities, as compared to 5 percent of the household income of median income families.(c) The increased energy burden for low-income families often results in vulnerable populations making tough choices between essential costs, such as food, transportation, and heating or cooling their home in a safe manner.(d) Since 1975, California has administered the state’s share of these federal programs, including the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program Block Grant (LIHEAP), provided for pursuant to the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981, as amended (42 U.S.C. Sec. 8621 et seq.), and the United States Department of Energy Weatherization Assistance Program (DOE WAP), provided for pursuant to Title IV of the Energy Conservation and Production Act (Public Law 94-385, as amended) and pursuant to the United States Housing and Urban Development Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-550, as amended),
				  in conjunction with other federal and state antipoverty programs that assist low-income families with achieving self-sufficiency.(e) California has embarked on a new era of leadership to achieve ambitious energy goals including energy conservation and efficiency, alternative fuels, and reduce carbon emissions. A critical pathway to achieving these goals is the strategic reorganization and consolidation of various energy-related programs, to maximize the outcomes of those individual programs in support of the state’s energy plans.(f) Consolidating the state’s federally funded low-income energy programs in a new Department of Energy can assist the state with achieving the objectives of the state’s energy plans through the quantification of the energy conserved and carbon emissions reduced as a result of the low-income
				  weatherization activities.(g) The funds from the federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5) are appropriated to the Department of Community Services and Development to implement the state’s federally funded low-income energy programs.(h) By reorganizing the state’s low-income energy programs, including LIHEAP and DOE WAP, into the new Department of Energy, it is the intent of the Legislature to support the accomplishment of the state’s energy plans, while not diminishing or sacrificing the primary federal purposes of these programs that are all of the following:(1) Assist low-income households with reducing their energy burden through cash assistance and weatherization.(2) Prioritize the needs of vulnerable populations including the elderly, families with young children, and people dependent on electrical medical equipment.(3) Help low-income families achieve self sufficiency.(i) It is the intent of the Legislature to have the Department of Community Services and Development administer the federal low-income energy programs through December 31, 2012, to ensure continuous allocation and distribution of funds from the federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. After that date, the federally funded low-income energy programs should be administered by the Department of Energy. SEC. 28. Section 16366.2 of the Government
		  Code is amended to read:16366.2. As used in this article:, “local service provider” means a public or private nonprofit entity, as defined by federal law and regulation, that provides service directly to eligible beneficiaries.(a)“Service provider” means any public or private nonprofit agency which provides service directly to categorical populations.(b)“Consolidated program” means any program which the state has the option to fund with the block grant.(c)“Categorical populations” means those recipients of services provided pursuant to a program listed in Section 16366.4.(d)“Block grant funds” shall have the same meaning as defined in federal law in existence on January 1, 1982.SEC. 29. Section 16366.3 of the Government
		  Code is repealed.16366.3.Federal block grant legislation provides that, for the first fiscal year, states have the option to accept or reject designated block grants. Consistent with this federal policy, the state shall, prior to July 1, 1982, accept only those block grants that meet all of the following criteria:(a)The block grant includes programs and services that the state has previously administered.(b)The block grant program, and funding, has been previously integrated into state and local service systems.(c)The block grant program does not require increased state or local matching funds.(d)There is a distinct advantage as a result of state assumption.SEC. 30. Section 16366.35 of the
		  Government Code is amended to read:16366.35. Counties Local service providers designated by the state shall be granted maximum flexibility in administering federal categorical and block grant programs to the extent permitted by state planning requirements. It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this section to provide counties the local service providers maximum flexibility in setting priorities in these programs for any reduced funding
				  consistent with federal and state law and policy.SEC. 31. Section 16366.4 of the Government
		  Code is repealed.16366.4.(a)Based on the criteria specified in Section 16366.3, the Legislature directs the state to assume administrative responsibility for the following federal block grants in the 1981–82 state fiscal year:(1)Low-income home energy assistance.(2)Social services (pursuant to Title XX of the Social Security Act).(b)Block grant programs not meeting the criteria specified in Section 16366.3, which shall not be assumed by the state until July 1, 1982, include all of the following:(1)Preventive health and health services.(2)Maternal and child health services.(3)Primary care.(4)Alcohol, drug abuse, and mental health services.(5)Community services.(6) Community development.SEC. 32. Section 16366.5 of the Government
		  Code is repealed.16366.5.For the 1981–82 state fiscal year, block grants which the state chooses to accept and administer shall be disbursed in grant form and shall be governed by the provisions of this section. The provisions of this section, however, shall apply only to the amount retained in the block and not to the amount transferred into another block, as permitted by federal law. The Governor may transfer funds between block grants only in an amount authorized by the Legislature.(a)The Legislature, in cooperation with the appropriate state departments and service providers, shall undertake a study to evaluate the current levels of administrative costs incurred under the Title XX block grant and designate methods for determining and establishing acceptable ceilings for those costs.(b)For the Low-Income Energy Assistance Block Grant, the amount spent during the 1981–82 state fiscal year by the state and by service providers for program administration of all federal categorical and block grant programs shall not exceed the percentage levels of administrative costs incurred in the 1980–81 fiscal year which were approved by the Legislature and reflected in each service provider grant in effect on July 1, 1981. In no event shall these administrative costs exceed 5 percent.(c)The state shall maintain its level of funding for categorical programs consolidated into federal block grants.SEC. 33. Section 16366.6 of the Government
		  Code is amended to read:16366.6. (a) The funds shall be used to serve the populations defined in the federal statutes and regulations which governed the federal categorical programs as of January 30, 1981, and which are consolidated into the block grants beneficiaries and households, as defined in the federal laws and regulations establishing the block grant programs or as further defined in this chapter.(b) Federal funds shall be received by the Controller and held in a separate account of the federal trust fund in accordance with state law governing the
				  administration of federal funds.(c) The funds shall be disbursed to 1980–81 fiscal year grantees of categorical grant programs consolidated into the federal block grants in an amount which reflects the overall change in federal categorical funds which were available in the 1980–81 federal fiscal year.SEC. 34. Section 16366.7 of the Government
		  Code is amended to read:Since federal block grant funds were reduced by an average of 26 percent during the 1981–82 fiscal year and are proposed for further reductions during the 1982–83 fiscal year, the Legislature declares that the state’s administrative costs and processes must be reduced in order to ensure that maximum funds are available to continue essential direct human services.16366.7. Therefore, notwithstanding Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all of the following state procedures shall be implemented within 60 days after the effective date of this section:(a) All state agencies, offices, or departments administering federal block grant funds shall have the authority, subject to the approval of the Department of Finance, to grant advance payments of federal funds to contractors or local governmental agencies in any amounts as the administering state department deems necessary for startup or continued provision of services or program operation.(b) Departmental service contracts utilizing federal block grant funds shall be exempt from approval by the Department of Finance and the State Department of General Services prior to their execution. Instead, the proper state fiscal controls over federal block grant funds shall be insured by all of the following provisions:(1) State departments that award block grant funds to local agencies shall permit, as appropriate, to the

		  Code is repealed.16366.9.(a)The 1981–82 state fiscal year shall be a transition year during which the Legislature shall require certain critical reviews and reports as it deems necessary to assist in developing the policies to govern the state’s assumption of both federal categorical and block grants as contained in the federal Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981. The Governor shall instruct state agencies to cooperate fully with the Legislature in complying with this article.(b)All departments affected shall prepare a separate summary of programs, funding levels, contracting progress, and clients affected by funding reductions during the 1981–82 state fiscal year and separately identify the transition programs for which they would have any policy or administrative responsibilities no later than October 15, 1981.

Electrical corporations shall continue to provide all metering, billing, collection, and customer service to retail customers that participate in community choice aggregation programs. Bills sent by the electrical corporation to retail customers shall identify the community choice aggregator as providing the electrical energy component of the bill. The commission shall determine the terms and conditions under which the electrical
				  corporation provides services to community choice aggregators and retail customers.(10) (A) A city, county, or city and county that elects to implement a community choice aggregation program within its jurisdiction pursuant to this chapter shall do so by ordinance.(B) Two or more cities, counties, or cities and counties may participate as a group in a community choice aggregation pursuant to this chapter, through a joint powers agency established pursuant to Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 6500) of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code, if each entity adopts an ordinance pursuant to subparagraph (A).(11) Following adoption of aggregation through the ordinance described in paragraph (10), the program shall allow any retail customer to opt out and to continue to be served as a bundled
				  service customer by the existing electrical corporation, or its successor in interest. Delivery services shall be provided at the same rates, terms, and conditions, as approved by the commission, for community choice aggregation customers and customers that have entered into a direct transaction where applicable, as determined by the commission. Once enrolled in the aggregated entity, any ratepayer that chooses to opt out within 60 days or two billing cycles of the date of enrollment may do so without penalty and shall be entitled to receive default service pursuant to paragraph (3) of subdivision (a). Customers that return to the electrical corporation for procurement services shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as are applicable to other returning direct access customers from the same class, as determined by the commission, as authorized by the commission pursuant to this code or any other provision of law. Any reentry fees to be imposed after the opt-out period specified in this paragraph,
				  shall be approved by the commission and shall reflect the cost of reentry. The commission shall exclude any amounts previously determined and paid pursuant to subdivisions (d), (e), and (f) from the cost of reentry.(12) Nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing any city or any community choice retail load aggregator to restrict the ability of retail electricity customers to obtain or receive service from any authorized electric service provider in a manner consistent with law.(13) (A) The community choice aggregator shall fully inform participating customers at least twice within two calendar months, or 60 days, in advance of the date of commencing automatic enrollment. Notifications may occur concurrently with billing cycles. Following enrollment, the aggregated entity shall fully inform participating customers for not less than two
				  consecutive billing cycles. Notification may include, but is not limited to, direct mailings to customers, or inserts in water, sewer, or other utility bills. Any notification shall inform customers of both of the following:(i) That they are to be automatically enrolled and that the customer has the right to opt out of the community choice aggregator without penalty.(ii) The terms and conditions of the services offered.(B) The community choice aggregator may request the commission to approve and order the electrical corporation to provide the notification required in subparagraph (A). If the commission orders the electrical corporation to send one or more of the notifications required pursuant to subparagraph (A) in the electrical corporation’s normally scheduled monthly billing process, the electrical corporation
				  shall be entitled to recover from the community choice aggregator all reasonable incremental costs it incurs related to the notification or notifications. The electrical corporation shall fully cooperate with the community choice aggregator in determining the feasibility and costs associated with using the electrical corporation’s normally scheduled monthly billing process to provide one or more of the notifications required pursuant to subparagraph (A).(C) Each notification shall also include a mechanism by which a ratepayer may opt out of community choice aggregated service. The opt out may take the form of a self-addressed return postcard indicating the customer’s election to remain with, or return to, electrical energy service provided by the electrical corporation, or another straightforward means by which the customer may elect to derive electrical energy service through the electrical corporation providing service in the area.(14) The community choice aggregator shall register with the commission, which may require additional information to ensure compliance with basic consumer protection rules and other procedural matters.(15) Once the community choice aggregator’s contract is signed, the community choice aggregator shall notify the applicable electrical corporation that community choice service will commence within 30 days.(16) Once notified of a community choice aggregator program, the electrical corporation shall transfer all applicable accounts to the new supplier within a 30-day period from the date of the close of their normally scheduled monthly metering and billing process.(17) An electrical corporation shall recover from the community choice aggregator any costs
				  reasonably attributable to the community choice aggregator, as determined by the commission, of implementing this section, including, but not limited to, all business and information system changes, except for transaction-based costs as described in this paragraph. Any costs not reasonably attributable to a community choice aggregator shall be recovered from ratepayers, as determined by the commission. All reasonable transaction-based costs of notices, billing, metering, collections, and customer communications or other services provided to an aggregator or its customers shall be recovered from the aggregator or its customers on terms and at rates to be approved by the commission.(18) At the request and expense of any community choice aggregator, electrical corporations shall install, maintain and calibrate metering devices at mutually agreeable locations within or adjacent to the community aggregator’s political boundaries. The electrical
				  corporation shall read the metering devices and provide the data collected to the community aggregator at the aggregator’s expense. To the extent that the community aggregator requests a metering location that would require alteration or modification of a circuit, the electrical corporation shall only be required to alter or modify a circuit if such alteration or modification does not compromise the safety, reliability, or operational flexibility of the electrical corporation’s facilities. All costs incurred to modify circuits pursuant to this paragraph, shall be borne by the community aggregator.(d) (1) It is the intent of the Legislature that each retail end-use customer that has purchased power from an electrical corporation on or after February 1, 2001, should bear a fair share of the Department of Water Resources’

				  described in this article.(b) Increasing California’s reliance on eligible renewable energy resources may promote stable electricity prices, protect public health, improve environmental quality, stimulate sustainable economic development, create new employment opportunities, and reduce reliance on imported fuels.(c) The development of eligible renewable energy resources and the delivery of the electricity generated by those resources to customers in California may ameliorate air quality problems throughout the state and improve public health by reducing the burning of fossil fuels and the associated environmental impacts and by reducing in-state fossil fuel consumption.(d) The California Renewables Portfolio Standard Program is intended to complement the Renewable Energy Resources Program administered by the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission
				  Department of Energy and established pursuant to Chapter 8.6 (commencing with Section 25740) of Division 15 of the Public Resources Code.(e) New and modified electric transmission facilities may be necessary to facilitate the state achieving its renewables portfolio standard targets.Section 399.12 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to read:399.12. For purposes of this article, the following terms have the following meanings:(a) “Conduit hydroelectric facility” means a facility for the generation of electricity that uses only the hydroelectric potential of an existing pipe, ditch, flume, siphon, tunnel, canal, or other manmade conduit that is operated to distribute water for a beneficial use.(b) “Delivered” and “delivery” have the same meaning as provided in subdivision (a) of Section 25741 of the Public Resources Code.(c) “Eligible renewable energy resource” means an electric generating facility that meets the definition of “in-state renewable electricity
				  generation facility” in Section 25741 of the Public Resources Code, subject to the following limitations:(1) (A) An existing small hydroelectric generation facility of 30 megawatts or less shall be eligible only if a retail seller or local publicly owned electric utility owned or procured the electricity from the facility as of December 31, 2005. A new hydroelectric facility is not an eligible renewable energy resource if it will cause an adverse impact on instream beneficial uses or cause a change in the volume or timing of streamflow.(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), a conduit hydroelectric facility of 30 megawatts or less that commenced operation before January 1, 2006, is an eligible renewable energy resource. A conduit hydroelectric facility of 30 megawatts or less that commences operation after December 31, 2005, is an eligible renewable energy
				  resource so long as it does not cause an adverse impact on instream beneficial uses or cause a change in the volume or timing of streamflow.(2) A facility engaged in the combustion of municipal solid waste shall not be considered an eligible renewable resource unless it is located in Stanislaus County and was operational prior to September 26, 1996.(d) “Procure” means that a retail seller or local publicly owned electric utility receives delivered electricity generated by an eligible renewable energy resource that it owns or for which it has entered into an electricity purchase agreement. Nothing in this article is intended to imply that the purchase of electricity from third parties in a wholesale transaction is the preferred method of fulfilling a retail seller’s obligation to comply with this article or the obligation of a local publicly owned electric utility to meet its
				  renewables portfolio standard implemented pursuant to Section 387.(e) “Renewables portfolio standard” means the specified percentage of electricity generated by eligible renewable energy resources that a retail seller is required to procure pursuant to this article or the obligation of a local publicly owned electric utility to meet its renewables portfolio standard implemented pursuant to Section 387.(f) (1) “Renewable energy credit” means a certificate of proof, issued through the accounting system established by the Energy Commission Department of Energy pursuant to Section 399.13, that one unit of electricity was generated and delivered by an eligible renewable
				  energy resource.(2) “Renewable energy credit” includes all renewable and environmental attributes associated with the production of electricity from the eligible renewable energy resource, except for an emissions reduction credit issued pursuant to Section 40709 of the Health and Safety Code and any credits or payments associated with the reduction of solid waste and treatment benefits created by the utilization of biomass or biogas fuels.(3) No electricity generated by an eligible renewable energy resource attributable to the use of nonrenewable fuels, beyond a de minimis quantity, as determined by the Energy Commission Department of Energy, shall result in the creation of a renewable
				  energy credit.(g) “Retail seller” means an entity engaged in the retail sale of electricity to end-use customers located within the state, including any of the following:(1) An electrical corporation, as defined in Section 218.(2) A community choice aggregator. The commission shall institute a rulemaking to determine the manner in which a community choice aggregator will participate in the renewables portfolio standard program subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to an electrical corporation.(3) An electric service provider, as defined in Section 218.3, for all sales of electricity to customers beginning January 1, 2006.

				  does not impair a contract entered into between an electric service provider and a retail customer prior to the suspension of direct access by the commission pursuant to Section 80110 of the Water Code.(4) “Retail seller” does not include any of the following:(A) A corporation or person employing cogeneration technology or producing electricity consistent with subdivision (b) of Section 218.(B) The Department of Water Resources acting in its capacity pursuant to Division 27 (commencing with Section 80000) of the Water Code.(C) A local publicly owned electric utility.Section 399.12.5 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to read:399.12.5. (a) Notwithstanding subdivision (c) of Section 399.12, a small hydroelectric generation facility that satisfies the criteria for an eligible renewable energy resource pursuant to Section 399.12 shall not lose its eligibility if efficiency improvements undertaken after January 1, 2008, cause the generating capacity of the facility to exceed 30 megawatts, and the efficiency improvements do not result in an adverse impact on instream beneficial uses or cause a change in the volume or timing of streamflow. The entire generating capacity of the facility shall be eligible.(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (c) of Section 399.12, the incremental increase in the amount of electricity generated from a hydroelectric generation
				  facility as a result of efficiency improvements at the facility, is electricity from an eligible renewable energy resource, without regard to the electrical output of the facility, if all of the following conditions are met:(1) The incremental increase is the result of efficiency improvements from a retrofit that do not result in an adverse impact on instream beneficial uses or cause a change in the volume or timing of streamflow.(2) The hydroelectric generation facility has, within the immediately preceding 15 years, received certification from the State Water Resources Control Board pursuant to Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. Sec. 1341), or has received certification from a regional board to which the state board has delegated authority to issue certification, unless the facility is exempt from certification because there is no potential for discharge into waters
				  of the United States.(3) The hydroelectric generation facility was operational prior to January 1, 2007, the efficiency improvements are initiated on or after January 1, 2008, the efficiency improvements are not the result of routine maintenance activities, as determined by the Energy Commission Department of Energy, by action of the California Energy Board, and the efficiency improvements were not included in any resource plan sponsored by the facility owner prior to January 1, 2008.(4) All of the incremental increase in electricity resulting from the efficiency improvements are demonstrated to result from a long-term financial commitment by the retail seller or local publicly owned
				  electric utility. For purposes of this paragraph, “long-term financial commitment” means either new ownership investment in the facility by the retail seller or local publicly owned electric utility or a new or renewed contract with a term of 10 or more years, which includes procurement of the incremental generation.(c) The incremental increase in the amount of electricity generated from a hydroelectric generation facility as a result of efficiency improvements at the facility are not eligible for supplemental energy payments pursuant to the Renewable Energy Resources Program (Chapter 8.6 (commencing with Section 25740) of Division 15 of the Public Resources Code), or a successor program.Section 399.13 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to read:399.13. The Energy Commission Department of Energy, by action of the California Energy Board, shall do all of the following:(a) Certify eligible renewable energy resources that it determines meet the criteria described in subdivision (b) of Section 399.12.(b) Design and implement an accounting system to verify compliance with the renewables portfolio standard by retail sellers, to ensure that electricity generated by an eligible renewable energy resource is counted only once for the purpose of
				  meeting the renewables portfolio standard of this state or any other state, to certify renewable energy credits produced by eligible renewable energy resources, and to verify retail product claims in this state or any other state. In establishing the guidelines governing this accounting system, the Energy Commission Department of Energy shall collect data from electricity market participants that it deems necessary to verify compliance of retail sellers, in accordance with the requirements of this article and the California Public Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code). In seeking data from electrical corporations, the Energy Commission
				  Department of Energy shall request data from the commission. The commission shall collect data from electrical corporations and remit the data to the Energy Commission Department of Energy within 90 days of the request.(c) Establish a system for tracking and verifying renewable energy credits that, through the use of independently audited data, verifies the generation and delivery of electricity associated with each renewable energy credit and protects against multiple counting of the same renewable energy credit. The Energy Commission Department of
				  Energy
				  shall consult with other western states and with the Western Electricity Coordinating Council in the development of this system.(d) Certify, for purposes of compliance with the renewable portfolio standard requirements by a retail seller, the eligibility of renewable energy credits associated with deliveries of electricity by an eligible renewable energy resource to a local publicly owned electric utility, if the Energy Commission Department of Energy determines that the following conditions have been satisfied:(1) The local publicly owned electric utility that is procuring the electricity is in compliance with the requirements of Section 387.(2) The local publicly owned electric utility has established an annual renewables portfolio standard target comparable to those applicable to an electrical corporation, is procuring sufficient eligible renewable energy resources to satisfy the targets, and will not fail to satisfy the targets in the event that the renewable energy credit is sold to another retail seller.Section 399.15 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to read:399.15. (a) In order to fulfill unmet long-term resource needs, the commission shall establish a renewables portfolio standard requiring all electrical corporations to procure a minimum quantity of electricity generated by eligible renewable energy resources as a specified percentage of total kilowatthours sold to their retail end-use customers each calendar year, subject to limits on the total amount of costs expended above the market prices determined in subdivision (c), to achieve the targets established under this article.(b) The commission shall implement annual procurement targets for each retail seller as follows:(1) Each retail seller shall, pursuant to
				  subdivision (a), increase its total procurement of eligible renewable energy resources by at least an additional 1 percent of retail sales per year so that 20 percent of its retail sales are procured from eligible renewable energy resources no later than December 31, 2010. A retail seller with 20 percent of retail sales procured from eligible renewable energy resources in any year shall not be required to increase its procurement of renewable energy resources in the following year.(2) For purposes of setting annual procurement targets, the commission shall establish an initial baseline for each retail seller based on the actual percentage of retail sales procured from eligible renewable energy resources in 2001, and to the extent applicable, adjusted going forward pursuant to Section 399.12.(3) Only for purposes of establishing these targets, the commission shall include all
				  electricity sold to retail customers by the Department of Water Resources pursuant to Section 80100 of the Water Code in the calculation of retail sales by an electrical corporation.(4) In the event that a retail seller fails to procure sufficient eligible renewable energy resources in a given year to meet any annual target established pursuant to this subdivision, the retail seller shall procure additional eligible renewable energy resources in subsequent years to compensate for the shortfall, subject to the limitation on costs for electrical corporations established pursuant to subdivision (d).(c) The commission shall establish a methodology to determine the market price of electricity for terms corresponding to the length of contracts with eligible renewable energy resources, in consideration of the following:(1) The long-term market price of electricity for fixed price contracts, determined pursuant to an electrical corporation’s general procurement activities as authorized by the commission.(2) The long-term ownership, operating, and fixed-price fuel costs associated with fixed-price electricity from new generating facilities.(3) The value of different products including baseload, peaking, and as-available electricity.(d) The commission shall establish, for each electrical corporation, a limitation on the total costs expended above the market prices determined in subdivision (c) for the procurement of eligible renewable energy resources to achieve the annual procurement targets established under this article.(1) The cost limitation shall
				  be equal to the amount of funds transferred to each electrical corporation by the former State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 25743 of the Public Resources Code and the 51.5 percent of the funds which would have been collected through January 1, 2012, from the customers of the electrical corporation based on the renewable energy public goods charge in effect as of January 1, 2007.(2) The above-market costs of a contract selected by an electrical corporation may be counted toward the cost limitation if all of the following conditions are satisfied:(A) The contract has been approved by the commission and
				  was selected through a competitive solicitation pursuant to the requirements of subdivision (d) of Section 399.14.(B) The contract covers a duration of no less than 10 years.(C) The contracted project is a new or repowered facility commencing commercial operations on or after January 1, 2005.(D) No purchases of renewable energy credits may be eligible for consideration as an above-market cost.(E) The above-market costs of a contract do not include any indirect expenses including imbalance energy charges, sale of excess energy, decreased generation from existing resources, or transmission upgrades.(3) If the cost limitation for an electrical corporation is insufficient to support the
				  total costs expended above the market prices determined in subdivision (c) for the procurement of eligible renewable energy resources satisfying the conditions of paragraph (2), the commission shall allow the electrical corporation to limit its procurement to the quantity of eligible renewable energy resources that can be procured at or below the market prices established in subdivision (c).(4) Nothing in this This section prevents
				  does not prevent an electrical corporation from voluntarily proposing to procure eligible renewable energy resources at above-market prices that are not counted toward the cost limitation. Any voluntary procurement involving above-market costs shall be subject to commission approval prior to the expense being recovered in rates.(e) The establishment of a renewables portfolio standard shall not constitute implementation by the commission of the federal Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-617).(f) The commission shall consult with the Energy Commission Department of Energy in calculating market prices under subdivision (c) and
				  establishing other renewables portfolio standard policies.Section 399.16 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to read:399.16. (a) The commission, by rule, may authorize the use of renewable energy credits to satisfy the requirements of the renewables portfolio standard established pursuant to this article, subject to the following conditions:(1) Prior to authorizing any renewable energy credit to be used toward satisfying annual procurement targets, the commission and the Energy Commission Department of Energy, by action of the California Energy Board, shall conclude that the tracking system established pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 399.13, is
				  operational, is capable of independently verifying the electricity generated by an eligible renewable energy resource and delivered to the retail seller, and can ensure that renewable energy credits shall not be double counted by any seller of electricity within the service territory of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC).(2) A renewable energy credit shall be counted only once for compliance with the renewables portfolio standard of this state or any other state, or for verifying retail product claims in this state or any other state.(3) The electricity is delivered to a retail seller, the Independent System Operator, or a local publicly owned electric utility.(4) All revenues received by an electrical corporation for the sale of a renewable energy credit shall be credited to the benefit of
				  ratepayers.(5) No renewable Renewable energy credits shall not be created for electricity generated pursuant to any electricity purchase contract with a retail seller or a local publicly owned electric utility executed before January 1, 2005, unless the contract contains explicit terms and conditions specifying the ownership or disposition of those credits. Deliveries under those contracts shall be tracked through the accounting system described in subdivision (b) of Section 399.13 and included in the baseline quantity of eligible renewable energy resources of the purchasing retail seller pursuant to Section 399.15.(6) No renewable Renewable energy credits shall
				  not be created for electricity generated under any electricity purchase contract executed after January 1, 2005, pursuant to the federal Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. Sec. 2601 et seq.). Deliveries under the electricity purchase contracts shall be tracked through the accounting system described in subdivision (b) of Section 399.12 and count toward the renewables portfolio standard obligations of the purchasing retail seller.(7) The commission may limit the quantity of renewable energy credits that may be procured unbundled from electricity generation by any retail seller, to meet the requirements of this article.(8) No An electrical
				  corporation shall
				  not be obligated to procure renewable energy credits to satisfy the requirements of this article in the event that the total costs expended above the applicable market prices for the procurement of eligible renewable energy resources exceeds the cost limitation established pursuant to subdivision (d) of Section 399.15.(9) Any additional condition that the commission determines is reasonable.(b) The commission shall allow an electrical corporation to recover the reasonable costs of purchasing renewable energy credits in rates.Section 399.17 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to read:399.17. (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, the requirements of this article apply to an electrical corporation with 60,000 or fewer customer accounts in California that serves retail end-use customers outside California.(b) For an electrical corporation with 60,000 or fewer customer accounts in California that serves retail end-use customers outside California, an eligible renewable energy resource includes a facility that is located outside California, if the facility is connected to the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) transmission system, provided all of the following conditions are met:(1) The electricity generated by the facility is
				  procured by the electrical corporation on behalf of its California customers,
				  and is not used to fulfill renewable energy procurement requirements in other states.(2) The electrical corporation participates in, and complies with, the accounting system administered by the Energy Commission Department of Energy, by action of the California Energy Board, pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 399.13.(3) The Energy Commission Department of Energy, by action of the California Energy Board, verifies that the electricity generated by the facility is eligible to meet the

The recovery corporation may request this determination by the commission in a separate proceeding or in an existing proceeding, or both. The recovery corporation shall in its application specify that
				  consumers within its service territory would benefit from reduced rates on a present value basis through the issuance of recovery bonds. The commission shall designate fixed recovery amounts and any associated fixed recovery tax amounts as recoverable in one or more financing orders if the commission determines, as part of its findings in connection with the financing order, that the designation of the fixed recovery amounts and any associated fixed recovery tax amounts, and the issuance of recovery bonds in connection with fixed recovery amounts, would reduce the rates on a present value basis that consumers within the recovery corporation’s service territory would pay if the financing order were not adopted. Fixed recovery amounts and any associated fixed recovery tax amounts shall only be imposed on existing and future consumers in the service territory. Consumers within the service territory shall continue to pay fixed recovery amounts and any associated fixed tax recovery amounts until the recovery
				  bonds are paid in full by the financing entity. Once the recovery bonds have been paid in full, the payment by consumers of fixed recovery amounts and fixed recovery tax amounts shall terminate.(b) The commission shall establish an effective mechanism that ensures recovery of recovery costs through fixed recovery amounts and any associated fixed recovery tax amounts from existing and future consumers in the service territory, provided that the costs shall not be recoverable from any of the following:(1) New load or incremental load of an existing consumer of the recovery corporation where the load is being met through a direct transaction and the transaction does not require the use of transmission or distribution facilities owned by the recovery corporation.(2) Customer Generation
				  generation departing load that is exempt from Department of Water Resources power charges pursuant to the commission’s Decision No. 03-04-030, as modified by Decision No. 03-04-041, and as clarified and affirmed by Decision No. 03-05-039, except that the load shall pay the costs as a component of and in proportion to any purchase of electricity delivered by the recovery corporation under standby or other service made following its departure.(3) The Department of Water Resources, or its successor, the Department of Energy, with respect to the pumping, generation, and transmission facilities and operations of the State Water Resources Development System, except to the extent that system facilities receive electric service from the recovery corporation on or after December 19, 2003, under a commission approved
				  commission-approved tariff.(4) Retail electric load, continuously served by a local publicly owned electric utility from January 1, 2000, through the effective date of the act adding this section.(5) Load that thereafter comes to subsequently take electric service from a city where all the following conditions are met:(A) The new load is from locations that never received electric service from the recovery corporation.(B) The city owns and operates the local publicly owned electric utility.(C) The local publicly owned electric utility served more than 95 percent of the customers receiving electric service residing within the city limits prior to December 19, 2003.(D) The city annexed the territory in which the load is located on or after December 19, 2003.(E) Following annexation, the city provides all municipal services to the annexed territory that the city provides to other territory within the city limits, including electric service.(F) The total load exempt from paying fixed recovery amounts and associated fixed recovery tax amounts pursuant to subparagraphs (A) through (D), inclusive, does not exceed 50 megawatts, as determined by the commission, and any load above the 50 megawatt exemption amount shall be responsible for paying
				  recovery amounts and associated fixed recovery tax amounts, except as provided in subdivision (c).(c) Except as provided in paragraphs (4) and (5) of subdivision (b), the commission shall determine the extent to which fixed recovery amounts and any associated fixed recovery tax amounts are recoverable from new municipal load, consistent with the commission’s determination in the limited rehearing granted in Decision 03-08-076. The determination of the commission shall be made on the earlier of the date it adopts a financing order or December 31, 2004.(d) Except as provided in paragraphs (4) and (5) of subdivision (b) and in subdivision (c), the obligation to pay fixed recovery amounts and any associated fixed recovery tax amounts cannot be avoided by the formation of a local publicly owned electric utility on or after December 19, 2003, or by annexation of any portion of the
				  service territory of the recovery corporation by an existing local publicly owned electric utility.(e) Recovery bonds authorized by the commission’s financing orders may be issued in one or more series on or before December 31, 2006.(f) The commission may issue financing orders in accordance with this article to facilitate the recovery, financing, or refinancing of recovery costs. A financing order may be adopted only upon the application of the recovery corporation and shall become effective in accordance with its terms only after the recovery corporation files with the commission the recovery corporation’s written consent to all terms and conditions of the financing order. A financing order may specify how amounts collected from a consumer shall be allocated between fixed recovery amounts, any associated fixed recovery tax amounts, and other charges.(g) Notwithstanding Section 455.5 or 1708, or any other provision of law, except as otherwise provided in Section 848.7 or in this subdivision with respect to recovery property that has been made the basis for the issuance of recovery bonds and with respect to any associated fixed recovery tax amounts, the financing order, the fixed recovery amounts and any associated fixed recovery tax amounts shall be irrevocable, and the commission shall not have authority either by rescinding, altering, or amending the financing order or otherwise, to revalue or revise for ratemaking purposes, the recovery costs or the costs of recovering, financing, or refinancing the recovery costs, determine that the fixed recovery amounts, any associated fixed recovery tax amounts or rates are unjust or unreasonable, or in any way reduce or impair the value of recovery property or of the right to receive any associated fixed recovery tax amounts either directly or
				  indirectly by taking fixed recovery amounts or any associated fixed recovery tax amounts into account when setting other rates for the recovery corporation or when setting charges for the Department of Water Resources, or its successor, the Department of Energy; nor shall the amount of revenues arising with respect thereto be subject to reduction, impairment, postponement, or termination. Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, the State of California does hereby pledge and agree with the recovery corporation, owners of recovery property, and holders of recovery bonds that the state shall neither limit nor alter the fixed recovery amounts, any associated fixed recovery tax amounts, recovery property, financing orders, or any rights thereunder until the recovery bonds, together with the interest thereon, are fully paid and discharged, and any associated fixed recovery tax amounts have been
				  satisfied or, in the alternative, have been refinanced through an additional issue of recovery bonds; provided nothing contained in this section shall preclude the limitation or alteration if and when adequate provision shall be made by law for the protection of the recovery corporation, owners, and holders. The financing entity is authorized to include this pledge and undertaking for the state in these recovery bonds. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the commission shall approve adjustments to the fixed recovery amounts and any associated fixed recovery tax amounts as may be necessary to ensure timely recovery of all recovery costs that are the subject of the pertinent financing order, and the costs of capital associated with the recovery, financing, or refinancing thereof, including servicing and retiring the recovery bonds contemplated by the financing order. When setting other rates for the recovery corporation, nothing in
				  this subdivision shall does not prevent the commission from taking into account either of the following:(1) Any collection of fixed recovery amounts in excess of amounts actually required to pay recovery costs financed or refinanced by recovery bonds.(2) Any collection of fixed recovery tax amounts in excess of amounts actually required to pay federal and State of California income and franchise taxes associated with fixed recovery amounts; provided that this would not result in a recharacterization of the tax, accounting, and other intended characteristics of the financing, including, but not limited to, either of the following:(A) Treating the recovery bonds as debt of the recovery corporation or its affiliates for federal income tax purposes.(B) Treating the transfer of the recovery property by the recovery corporation as a true sale for bankruptcy purposes.(h) (1) Financing orders issued under this article do not constitute a debt or liability of the state or of any political subdivision thereof, and do not constitute a pledge of the full faith and credit of the state or any of its political subdivisions, but are payable solely from the funds provided therefor under this article and shall be consistent with Sections 1 and 18 of Article XVI of the California Constitution. This subdivision shall in no way preclude bond guarantees or enhancements pursuant to this article. All recovery bonds shall contain on the face
				  thereof a statement to the following effect: “Neither the full faith and credit nor the taxing power of the State of California is pledged to the payment of the principal of, or interest on, this bond.”(2) The issuance of recovery bonds under this article shall not directly, indirectly, or contingently obligate the state or any political subdivision thereof to levy or to pledge any form of taxation therefor or to make any appropriation for their payment.(i) The commission shall establish procedures for the expeditious processing of applications for financing orders, including the approval or disapproval thereof within 120 days of the recovery corporation making application therefor. The commission shall provide in any financing order for a procedure for the expeditious approval by the commission of periodic adjustments to the fixed recovery amounts and any associated fixed
				  recovery tax amounts that are the subject of the pertinent financing order, as required by subdivision (g). The procedure shall require the commission to determine whether the adjustments are required on each anniversary of the issuance of the financing order, and at the additional intervals as may be provided for in the financing order, and for the adjustments, if required, to be approved within 90 days of each anniversary of the issuance of the financing order, or of each additional interval provided for in the financing order.(j) Fixed recovery amounts are recovery property when, and to the extent that, a financing order authorizing the fixed recovery amounts has become effective in accordance with this article, and the recovery property shall thereafter continuously exist as property for all purposes with all of the rights and privileges of this article for the period and to the extent provided in the financing order, but in any event
				  until the recovery bonds are paid in full, including all principal, interest, premium, costs, and arrearages thereon.(k) This article and any financing order made pursuant to this article do not amend, reduce, modify, or otherwise affect the right of the Department of Water Resources, or its successor, the Department of Energy, to recover its revenue requirements and to receive the charges that it is to recover and receive pursuant to Division 27 (commencing with Section 80000) of the Water Code, or pursuant to any agreement entered into by the commission and the Department of Water Resources department pursuant to that
				  division.Section 1001 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to read:1001. No (a) (1) A railroad corporation whose railroad is operated primarily by electric energy, or a street railroad corporation, gas corporation, electrical corporation, telegraph corporation, telephone corporation, water corporation, or sewer system corporation shall not begin the construction of a street railroad, or of a line, plant, or system, or of any extension

Only credit earned prior to that date shall be made to a benefiting account.(g) The Legislature finds and declares that credit for a benefiting account for the electricity output from the PVUSA are is in the public interest in order to value the production of this unique, wholly renewable resource electricity generation facility located in, and owned in part by, the City of Davis. Because of the unique circumstances applicable only to the PVUSA, a statute of general applicability cannot be enacted within the meaning of subdivision (b) of Section 16 of Article IV of the California Constitution. Therefore, this special
				  statute is necessary.Section 2827 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to read:2827. (a) The Legislature finds and declares that a program to provide net energy metering combined with net surplus compensation, co-energy metering, and wind energy co-metering for eligible customer-generators is one way to encourage substantial private investment in renewable energy resources, stimulate in-state economic growth, reduce demand for electricity during peak consumption periods, help stabilize California’s energy supply infrastructure, enhance the continued diversification of California’s energy resource mix, reduce interconnection and administrative costs for electricity suppliers, and encourage conservation and efficiency.(b) As used in this section, the following terms have the following meanings:(1) “Co-energy metering” means a program that is the same in all other respects as a net energy metering program, except that the local publicly owned electric utility has elected to apply a generation-to-generation energy and time-of-use credit formula as provided in subdivision (i).(2) “Electrical cooperative” means an electrical cooperative as defined in Section 2776.(3) “Electric utility” means an electrical corporation, a local publicly owned electric utility, or an electrical cooperative, or any other entity, except an electric service provider, that offers electrical service. This section shall not apply to a local publicly owned electric utility that serves more than 750,000 customers and that also conveys water to its customers.(4) “Eligible
				  customer-generator” means a residential, small commercial customer as defined in subdivision (h) of Section 331, commercial, industrial, or agricultural customer of an electric utility, who uses a solar or a wind turbine electrical generating facility, or a hybrid system of both, with a capacity of not more than one megawatt that is located on the customer’s owned, leased, or rented premises, and is interconnected and operates in parallel with the electric grid, and is intended primarily to offset part or all of the customer’s own electrical requirements.(5) “Net energy metering” means measuring the difference between the electricity supplied through the electric grid and the electricity generated by an eligible customer-generator and fed back to the electric grid over a 12-month period as described in subdivisions (c) and (h).(6) “Net surplus customer-generator” means an
				  eligible customer-generator that generates more electricity during a 12-month period than is supplied by the electric utility to the eligible customer-generator during the same 12-month period.(7) “Net surplus electricity” means all electricity generated by an eligible customer-generator measured in kilowatthours over a 12-month period that exceeds the amount of electricity consumed by that eligible customer-generator.(8) “Net surplus electricity compensation” means a per kilowatthour rate offered by the electric utility to the net surplus customer-generator for net surplus electricity that is set by the ratemaking authority pursuant to subdivision (h).(9) “Ratemaking authority” means, for an electrical corporation or electrical cooperative, the commission, and for a local publicly owned electric utility, the
				  local elected body responsible for setting the rates of the local publicly owned utility.(10) “Wind energy co-metering” means any wind energy project greater than 50 kilowatts, but not exceeding one megawatt, where the difference between the electricity supplied through the electric grid and the electricity generated by an eligible customer-generator and fed back to the electric grid over a 12-month period is as described in subdivision (h). Wind energy co-metering shall be accomplished pursuant to Section 2827.8.(c) (1) Every electric utility shall develop a standard contract or tariff providing for net energy metering, and shall make this standard contract or tariff available to eligible customer-generators, upon request, on a first-come-first-served basis until the time that the total rated generating capacity used by eligible customer-generators exceeds
				  2.5 percent of the electric utility’s aggregate customer peak demand. Net energy metering shall be accomplished using a single meter capable of registering the flow of electricity in two directions. An additional meter or meters to monitor the flow of electricity in each direction may be installed with the consent of the eligible customer-generator, at the expense of the electric utility, and the additional metering shall be used only to provide the information necessary to accurately bill or credit the eligible customer-generator pursuant to subdivision (h), or to collect solar or wind electric generating system performance information for research purposes. If the existing electrical meter of an eligible customer-generator is not capable of measuring the flow of electricity in two directions, the eligible customer-generator shall be responsible for all expenses involved in purchasing and installing a meter that is able to measure electricity flow in two directions. If an additional meter or meters are
				  installed, the net energy metering calculation shall yield a result identical to that of a single meter. An eligible customer-generator that is receiving service other than through the standard contract or tariff may elect to receive service through the standard contract or tariff until the electric utility reaches the generation limit set forth in this paragraph. Once the generation limit is reached, only eligible customer-generators that had previously elected to receive service pursuant to the standard contract or tariff have a right to continue to receive service pursuant to the standard contract or tariff. Eligibility for net energy metering does not limit an eligible customer-generator’s eligibility for any other rebate, incentive, or credit provided by the electric utility, or pursuant to any governmental program, including rebates and incentives provided pursuant to the California Solar Initiative.(2) (A) On an
				  annual basis, beginning in 2003, every electric utility shall make available to the ratemaking authority information on the total rated generating capacity used by eligible customer-generators that are customers of that provider in the provider’s service area and the net surplus electricity purchased by the electric utility pursuant to this section.(B) An electric service provider operating pursuant to Section 394 shall make available to the ratemaking authority the information required by this paragraph for each eligible customer-generator that is their customer for each service area of an electric corporation, local publicly owned electric utility, or electrical cooperative, in which the eligible customer-generator has net energy metering.(C) The ratemaking authority shall develop a process for making the information required by this paragraph available to electric utilities,
				  and for using that information to determine when, pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (3), an electric utility is not obligated to provide net energy metering to additional eligible customer-generators in its service area.(3) An electric utility is not obligated to provide net energy metering to additional eligible customer-generators in its service area when the combined total peak demand of all electricity used by eligible customer-generators served by all the electric utilities in that service area furnishing net energy metering to eligible customer-generators exceeds 2.5 percent of the aggregate customer peak demand of those electric utilities.(4) By January 1, 2010, the commission, in consultation with the Energy Commission, shall submit a report to the Governor and the Legislature on the costs and benefits of net energy metering, wind energy co-metering, and co-energy metering
				  to participating customers and nonparticipating customers and with options to replace the economic costs and benefits of net energy metering, wind energy co-metering, and co-energy metering with a mechanism that more equitably balances the interests of participating and nonparticipating customers, and that incorporates the findings of the report on economic and environmental costs and benefits of net metering required by subdivision (n).(d) Every electric utility shall make all necessary forms and contracts for net energy metering and net surplus electricity compensation service available for download from the Internet.(e) (1) Every electric utility shall ensure that requests for establishment of net energy metering and net surplus electricity compensation are processed in a time period not exceeding that for similarly situated customers requesting new
				  electric service, but not to exceed 30 working days from the date it receives a completed application form for net energy metering service or net surplus electricity compensation, including a signed interconnection agreement from an eligible customer-generator and the electric inspection clearance from the governmental authority having jurisdiction.(2) Every electric utility shall ensure that requests for an interconnection agreement from an eligible customer-generator are processed in a time period not to exceed 30 working days from the date it receives a completed application form from the eligible customer-generator for an interconnection agreement.(3) If an electric utility is unable to process a request within the allowable timeframe pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2), it shall notify the eligible customer-generator and the ratemaking authority of the reason for its inability
				  to process the request and the expected completion date.(f) (1) If a customer participates in direct transactions pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of Section 365 with an electric service provider that does not provide distribution service for the direct transactions, the electric utility that provides distribution service for the eligible customer-generator is not obligated to provide net energy metering or net surplus electricity compensation to the customer.(2) If a customer participates in direct transactions pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of Section 365 with an electric service provider, and the customer is an eligible customer-generator, the electric utility that provides distribution service for the direct transactions may recover from the customer’s electric service provider the incremental costs of metering and billing
				  service related to net energy metering and net surplus electricity compensation in an amount set by the ratemaking authority.(g) Except for the time-variant kilowatthour pricing portion of any tariff adopted by the commission pursuant to paragraph (4) of subdivision (a) of Section 2851, each net energy metering contract or tariff shall be identical, with respect to rate structure, all retail rate components, and any monthly charges, to the contract or tariff to which the same customer would be assigned if the customer did not use an eligible solar or wind electrical generating facility, except that eligible customer-generators shall not be assessed standby charges on the electrical generating capacity or the kilowatthour production of an eligible solar or wind electrical generating facility. The charges for all retail rate components for eligible customer-generators shall be based exclusively on the customer-generator’s net kilowatthour
				  consumption over a 12-month period, without regard to the eligible customer-generator’s choice as to from whom it purchases electricity that is not self-generated. Any new or additional demand charge, standby charge, customer charge, minimum monthly charge, interconnection charge, or any other charge that would increase an eligible customer-generator’s costs beyond those of other customers who are not eligible customer-generators in the rate class to which the eligible customer-generator would otherwise be assigned if the customer did not own, lease, rent, or otherwise operate an eligible solar or wind electrical generating facility are is contrary to the intent of this section, and shall not form a part of net energy metering contracts or tariffs.(h) For
				  eligible customer-generators, the net energy metering calculation shall be made by measuring the difference between the electricity supplied to the eligible customer-generator and the electricity generated by the eligible customer-generator and fed back to the electric grid over a 12-month period. The following rules shall apply to the annualized net metering calculation:(1) The eligible residential or small commercial customer-generator shall, at the end of each 12-month period following the date of final interconnection of the eligible customer-generator’s system with an electric utility, and at each anniversary date thereafter, be billed for electricity used during that 12-month period. The electric utility shall determine if the eligible residential or small commercial customer-generator was a net consumer or a net surplus customer-generator during that period.(2) At the end
				  of each 12-month period, where the electricity supplied during the period by the electric utility exceeds the electricity generated by the eligible residential or small commercial customer-generator during that same period, the eligible residential or small commercial customer-generator is a net electricity consumer and the electric utility shall be owed compensation for the eligible customer-generator’s net kilowatthour consumption over that 12-month period. The compensation owed for the eligible residential or small commercial customer-generator’s consumption shall be calculated as follows:(A) For all eligible customer-generators taking service under contracts or tariffs employing “baseline” and “over baseline” rates, any net monthly consumption of electricity shall be calculated according to the terms of the contract or tariff to which the same customer would be assigned to, or be eligible for, if the customer was not an eligible
				  customer-generator. If those same customer-generators are net generators over a billing period, the net kilowatthours generated shall be valued at the same price per kilowatthour as the electric utility would charge for the baseline quantity of electricity during that billing period, and if the number of kilowatthours generated exceeds the baseline quantity, the excess shall be valued at the same price per kilowatthour as the electric utility would charge for electricity over the baseline quantity during that billing period.(B) For all eligible customer-generators taking service under contracts or tariffs employing time-of-use rates, any net monthly consumption of electricity shall be calculated according to the terms of the contract or tariff to which the same customer would be assigned, or be eligible for, if the customer was not an eligible customer-generator. When those same customer-generators are net generators during any discrete
				  time-of-use period, the net kilowatthours produced shall be valued at the same price per kilowatthour as the electric utility would charge for retail kilowatthour sales during that same time-of-use period. If the eligible customer-generator’s time-of-use electrical meter is unable to measure the flow of electricity in two directions, paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) shall apply.(C) For all eligible residential and small commercial customer-generators and for each billing period, the net balance of moneys owed to the electric utility for net consumption of electricity or credits owed to the eligible customer-generator for net generation of electricity shall be carried forward as a monetary value until the end of each 12-month period. For all eligible commercial, industrial, and agricultural customer-generators, the net balance of moneys owed shall be paid in accordance with the electric utility’s normal billing cycle, except that if the
				  eligible commercial, industrial, or agricultural customer-generator is a net electricity producer over a normal billing cycle, any excess kilowatthours generated during the billing cycle shall be carried over to the following billing period as a monetary value, calculated according to the procedures set forth in this section, and appear as a credit on the eligible commercial, industrial, or agricultural customer-generator’s account, until the end of the annual period when paragraph (3) shall apply.(3) At the end of each 12-month period, where the electricity generated by the eligible customer-generator during the 12-month period exceeds the electricity supplied by the electric utility during that same period, the eligible customer-generator is a net surplus customer-generator and the electric utility shall, upon an affirmative election by the eligible customer-generator, either (A) provide net surplus electricity compensation for any net
				  surplus electricity generated during the prior 12-month period, or (B) allow the eligible customer-generator to apply the net surplus electricity as a credit for kilowatthours subsequently supplied by the electric utility to the surplus customer-generator. For an eligible customer-generator that does not affirmatively elect to receive service pursuant to net surplus electricity compensation, the electric utility shall retain any excess kilowatthours generated during the prior 12-month period. The eligible customer-generator not affirmatively electing to receive service pursuant to net surplus electricity compensation shall not be owed any compensation for the net surplus electricity unless the electric utility enters into a purchase agreement with the eligible customer-generator for those excess kilowatthours. Every electric utility shall, by January 31, 2010, provide notice to eligible customer-generators that they are eligible to receive net surplus electricity compensation for net surplus electricity,
				  that they must elect to receive net surplus electricity compensation, and that the 12-month period commences when the electric utility receives the eligible customer-generator’s election. The commission may, for an electric utility that is an electrical corporation or electrical cooperative, adopt requirements for providing notice and the manner by which eligible customer-generators may elect to receive net surplus electricity compensation.(4) (A) The ratemaking authority shall, by January 1, 2011, establish a net surplus electricity compensation valuation to compensate the net surplus customer-generator for the value of net surplus electricity generated by the net surplus customer-generator. The commission shall establish the valuation in a ratemaking proceeding. The ratemaking authority for a local publicly owned electric utility shall establish the valuation in a public proceeding. The net surplus electricity
				  compensation valuation shall be established so as to provide the net surplus customer-generator just and reasonable compensation for the value of net surplus electricity, while leaving other ratepayers unaffected. The ratemaking authority shall determine whether the compensation will include, where appropriate justification exists, either or both of the following components:(i) The value of the electricity itself.(ii) The value of the renewable attributes of the electricity.(B) In establishing the rate pursuant to subparagraph (A), the ratemaking authority shall ensure that the rate does not result in a shifting of costs between solar customer-generators and other bundled service customers.(5) (A) Upon adoption of the net
				  surplus electricity compensation rate by the ratemaking authority, any renewable energy credit, as defined in Section 399.12, for net surplus electricity purchased by the electric utility shall belong to the electric utility. Any renewable energy credit associated with electricity generated by the eligible customer-generator that is utilized by the eligible customer-generator shall remain the property of the eligible customer-generator.(B) Upon adoption of the net surplus electricity compensation rate by the ratemaking authority, the net surplus electricity purchased by the electric utility shall count toward the electric utility’s renewables portfolio standard annual procurement targets for the purposes of paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of Section 399.15, or for a local publicly owned electric utility, the renewables portfolio standard annual procurement targets established pursuant to Section 387.(6) The electric utility shall provide every eligible residential or small commercial customer-generator with net electricity consumption and net surplus electricity generation information with each regular bill. That information shall include the current monetary balance owed the electric utility for net electricity consumed, or the net surplus electricity generated, since the last 12-month period ended. Notwithstanding this subdivision, an electric utility shall permit that customer to pay monthly for net energy consumed.(7) If an eligible residential or small commercial customer-generator terminates the customer relationship with the electric utility, the electric utility shall reconcile the eligible customer-generator’s consumption and production of electricity during any part of a 12-month period following the last reconciliation, according to the requirements set forth in this
				  subdivision, except that those requirements shall apply only to the months since the most recent 12-month bill.(8) If an electric service provider or electric utility providing net energy metering to a residential or small commercial customer-generator ceases providing that electric service to that customer during any 12-month period, and the customer-generator enters into a new net energy metering contract or tariff with a new electric service provider or electric utility, the 12-month period, with respect to that new electric service provider or electric utility, shall commence on the date on which the new electric service provider or electric utility first supplies electric service to the customer-generator.(i) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the following provisions shall apply to an eligible customer-generator with a capacity of more than 10 kilowatts,
				  but not exceeding one megawatt, that receives electric service from a local publicly owned electric utility that has elected to utilize a co-energy metering program unless the local publicly owned electric utility chooses to provide service for eligible customer-generators with a capacity of more than 10 kilowatts in accordance with subdivisions (g) and (h):(1) The eligible customer-generator shall be required to utilize a meter, or multiple meters, capable of separately measuring electricity flow in both directions. All meters shall provide time-of-use measurements of electricity flow, and the customer shall take service on a time-of-use rate schedule. If the existing meter of the eligible customer-generator is not a time-of-use meter or is not capable of measuring total flow of energy in both directions, the eligible customer-generator shall be responsible for all expenses involved in purchasing and installing a meter that is both
				  time-of-use and able to measure total electricity flow in both directions. This subdivision shall not restrict the ability of an eligible customer-generator to utilize any economic incentives provided by a government agency or an electric utility to reduce its costs for purchasing and installing a time-of-use meter.(2) The consumption of electricity from the local publicly owned electric utility shall result in a cost to the eligible customer-generator to be priced in accordance with the standard rate charged to the eligible customer-generator in accordance with the rate structure to which the customer would be assigned if the customer did not use an eligible solar or wind electrical generating facility. The generation of electricity provided to the local publicly owned electric utility shall result in a credit to the eligible customer-generator and shall be priced in accordance with the generation component, established under the applicable
				  structure to which the customer would be assigned if the customer did not use an eligible solar or wind electrical generating facility.(3) All costs and credits shall be shown on the eligible customer-generator’s bill for each billing period. In any months in which the eligible customer-generator has been a net consumer of electricity calculated on the basis of value determined pursuant to paragraph (2), the customer-generator shall owe to the local publicly owned electric utility the balance of electricity costs and credits during that billing period. In any billing period in which the eligible customer-generator has been a net producer of electricity calculated on the basis of value determined pursuant to paragraph (2), the local publicly owned electric utility shall owe to the eligible customer-generator the balance of electricity costs and credits during that billing period. Any net credit to the eligible customer-generator of electricity
				  costs may be carried forward to subsequent billing periods, provided that a local publicly owned electric utility may choose to carry the credit over as a kilowatthour credit consistent with the provisions of any applicable contract or tariff, including any differences attributable to the time of generation of the electricity. At the end of each 12-month period, the local publicly owned electric utility may reduce any net credit due to the eligible customer-generator to zero.(j) A solar or wind turbine electrical generating system, or a hybrid system of both, used by an eligible customer-generator shall meet all applicable safety and performance standards established by the National Electrical Code, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and accredited testing laboratories, including Underwriters Laboratories and, where applicable, rules of the commission regarding safety and reliability. A customer-generator whose solar or
				  wind turbine electrical generating system, or a hybrid system of both, meets those standards and rules shall not be required to install additional controls, perform or pay for additional tests, or purchase additional liability insurance.(k) If the commission determines that there are cost or revenue obligations for an electric corporation, as defined in Section 218, that may not be recovered from customer-generators acting pursuant to this section, those obligations shall remain within the customer class from which any shortfall occurred and may not be shifted to any other customer class. Net energy metering and co-energy metering customers shall not be exempt from the public goods charges imposed pursuant to Article 7 (commencing with Section 381), Article 8 (commencing with Section 385), or Article 15 (commencing with Section 399) of Chapter 2.3 of Part 1. In its report to the Legislature, the commission shall examine different methods to
				  ensure that the public goods charges remain nonbypassable.(l) A net energy metering, co-energy metering, or wind energy co-metering customer shall reimburse the Department of Water Resources, or its successor, the Department of Energy for all charges that would otherwise be imposed on the customer by the commission to recover bond-related costs pursuant to an agreement between the commission and the Department of Water Resources, or its successor, the Department of Energy, pursuant to Section 80110 of the Water Code, as well as the costs of the department equal to the share of the department’s estimated net unavoidable power purchase contract costs attributable to the customer. The commission shall incorporate the determination
				  into an existing proceeding before the commission, and shall ensure that the charges are nonbypassable. Until the commission has made a determination regarding the nonbypassable charges, net energy metering, co-energy metering, and wind energy co-metering shall continue under the same rules, procedures, terms, and conditions as were applicable on December 31, 2002.(m) In implementing the requirements of subdivisions (k) and (l), an eligible customer-generator shall not be required to replace its existing meter except as set forth in paragraph (1) of subdivision (c), nor shall the electric utility require additional measurement of usage beyond that which is necessary for customers in the same rate class as the eligible customer-generator.(n) It is the intent of the Legislature that the Treasurer incorporate net energy metering, including net surplus electricity compensation,
				  co-energy metering, and wind energy co-metering projects undertaken pursuant to this section as sustainable building methods or distributive energy technologies for purposes of evaluating low-income housing projects.Section 9502 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to read:9502. On or before December 1, 1994, and on a biennial basis thereafter, each publicly owned electric and gas utility shall submit a report to the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission Department of Energy describing the status of their low-income weatherization programs required by Sections 9500 and 9501. Thereafter, as part of the biennial conservation report prepared pursuant to Section 25401.1 of the Public Resources Code, the commission shall report to the Legislature summarizing publicly owned utility efforts to comply with Sections 9500 and 9501.SEC. 379. The provisions of this act are severable. If any provision of this act or its application is held invalid, that invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application.
