						BlakesleeFebruary 27, 2009 An act to amend Section 26003 of, and to add Section 26029.2 26011.7 to, the Public Resources Code, relating to energy. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1111, as amended, Blakeslee.
											  Energy: California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority.The California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority Act established the California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority. The authority is authorized to do all things necessary and convenient to carry out the purposes of the act. The authority is also required to establish a renewable energy program to provide financial assistance, as defined, to certain entities for projects to generate new and renewable energy sources, develop clean and efficient distributed generation, and demonstrate the economic feasibility of new technologies. Existing law provides that the transfer of title of tangible personal property constituting a project under the act to the authority by a participating party or the lease or transfer of tangible personal property constituting a project under the act by the authority to a participating party
		pursuant to the act is not a “sale” or “purchase” for the purposes of the Sales and Use Tax Law.This bill would include as a project, machinery or equipment that is utilized for the design, technology transfer, manufacture, production, assembly, distribution, or service of an alternative source component. The bill would authorize the authority to recommend to the Board of Equalization that projects be exempt from sales and use tax, which the bill would include as “financial assistance” for the purposes of the act purchases, sales, or lease arrangements that qualify for exclusion from the Sales and Use Tax Law. The bill would require the authority to consider specified criteria in approving a project for which the purchase, sale, or lease of tangible personal property qualifies
		for the sales and use tax exclusion. The bill would require, when the sales and use tax exemptions granted by the board exclusion for projects approved by the authority exceed $100,000,000 annually, the authority to provide a 20-day notice to the Legislature for additional recommendation for exemption project approval.Digest Key
