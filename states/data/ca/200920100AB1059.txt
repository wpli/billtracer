The notice shall include all reasons constituting good cause for the termination and shall provide the dealer with 60 days to cure any claimed deficiency.

				  void. Except as provided in subdivision (d), a supplier may not terminate a dealer contract based on paragraph (12) of subdivision (c) unless the supplier gives the dealer notice of that action at least one year before the effective date of that action.

				  in the dealership without the consent of the supplier, who shall not withhold consent unreasonably.(2) Made a material misrepresentation or falsification of any record.(3) Filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or has had an involuntary petition in bankruptcy filed against the dealer that has not been dismissed within 60 days after the filing or is insolvent or in receivership.(4) Pleaded guilty to or has been convicted of a felony involving an act of moral turpitude.(5) Failed to operate in the normal course of business for seven consecutive business days, without the consent of the supplier, or has terminated the business.(6) Relocated or established a new or additional dealer’s
				  place of business without the supplier’s consent.(7) Materially defaulted under any chattel mortgage or other security agreement between the dealer and the supplier, or there has been a revocation of any guarantee of the dealer’s present or future obligations to the supplier. However, good cause does not exist if a person revokes any guarantee in connection with or following the transfer of that person’s entire ownership interest in the dealer unless the supplier requires that person to execute a new guarantee of the dealer’s present or future obligations in connection with that transfer of ownership interest.(8) Failed to satisfy any payment obligation as it became due and payable to the supplier, failed to promptly account to the supplier for any proceeds from the sale of equipment, or failed to hold those proceeds in trust for the benefit of the supplier.(9) Engaged in conduct that is injurious or detrimental to any of the following:(A) The dealer’s customers. This includes, but is not limited to, the following conduct: excessive pricing, misleading advertising, failure to provide service and replacement parts, and failure to perform warranty obligations.(B) The public welfare.(C) The representation or reputation of the supplier’s product.(10) Consistently failed to meet building and housekeeping requirements, or failed to provide adequate sales, service, or parts personnel commensurate with the dealer contract.(11) Consistently failed to comply with the applicable
				  licensing laws pertaining to the products and services being represented for and on the supplier’s behalf.(12) Consistently failed to meet and maintain the supplier’s requirements for reasonable standards and performance objectives, if the supplier has given the dealer reasonable standards and performance objectives that are based on the manufacturer’s experience in other comparable market areas.(d) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), if the sales, service, rental, and repair of a supplier’s product represents the lesser of 10 percent or three hundred fifty thousand dollars ($350,000) of the dealer’s total gross annual revenue that includes, but is not limited to, the sales, service, rental, or repair, for each dealer location, the supplier may terminate a dealer contract based on paragraph (12) of subdivision (c) upon providing the dealer with notice of that action at least 180
				  days before the effective date of that action. If the dealer achieves the supplier’s requirements for reasonable standards or performance objectives within 60 days of receipt of the termination notice, the notice shall be void and the dealer contract shall continue in full force and effect.(e) Notwithstanding a dealer contract that provides for exclusivity during the term of the contract, a supplier may begin contract negotiations with a potential replacement dealer 60 days prior to the expiration of the notice period that has been provided pursuant to subdivisions (b) or (d) if the dealer failed to achieve the supplier’s requirements for reasonable standards or performance objectives within 60 days of receipt of the termination notice. Nothing in this subdivision shall authorize a replacement dealer to conduct operations with a supplier during the term of a dealer contract.SEC. 9. Section 24071 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read:24071. The license of one spouse may be transferred to the other spouse when the application for transfer is made prior to the entry of a final decree of divorce, and the license of a decedent, minor ward, incompetent person, conservatee, debtor in a bankruptcy case, person for whose estate a receiver is appointed, or assignor for the benefit of creditors may be transferred by or to the surviving partners of a deceased licensee, the executor, administrator, conservator or guardian of an estate of a licensee, the surviving spouse of a deceased licensee in the event that the deceased licensee leaves no estate to be administered, the trustee of a bankrupt estate of a licensee, a receiver of the estate of a licensee, or an assignee for the benefit of creditors of a licensee with the consent of the assignor, or a license

The regular transfer fee provided in
				  Section 24072 shall be due and payable upon the subsequent transfer of 25 percent of the stock in a corporation to which a license has been transferred by a licensee or his or her spouse pursuant to this section, except if the transfer of stock is from a parent to his or her child or grandchild, in which case the fee shall be one-half of the regular transfer fee. In no case shall a fee be charged for the transfer of an importer’s license.

This exemption is not available for a rollup transaction as defined by Section 25014.6. The exemption is also not available for a transaction excluded from the definition of rollup transaction by virtue of paragraph (5) or (6) of subdivision (b) of Section 25014.6 if the transaction is one of a series of transactions that directly or indirectly through

				  assets, other than a rollup transaction (as defined in Section 25014.6), in consideration of the issuance of equity securities of another entity or any entity conversion transaction that meets the following conditions:(1) The exchange incident to a merger, consolidation, or sale of assets or the entity conversion transaction, had the exchange transaction involved the issuance of a security in a transaction subject to the provisions of Section 25110, would have been exempt from qualification by subdivision (f) of Section 25102, without giving effect to paragraph (3) thereof, and either of the following is applicable:(A) (i) Not less than 75 percent of the outstanding equity securities of each constituent or converting entity entitled to vote on the proposed transaction voted in favor of the transaction, (ii) not more than 10 percent of the outstanding equity

				  commissioner may, by rule, require the acquiring or surviving entity to file a notice of transaction under this section. However, the failure to file the notice or the failure to file the notice within the time specified by the rule of the commissioner shall not affect the availability of this exemption. An acquiring or surviving entity that fails to file the notice as provided by rule of the commissioner shall, within 15 business days after demand by the commissioner, file the notice and pay to the commissioner a fee equal to the fee payable had the transaction been qualified under Section 25110 or 25120.(i) Any exchange of securities in connection with any merger or consolidation or sale of corporate assets in consideration wholly or in part of the issuance of securities or any entity conversion transaction under, or pursuant to, a plan of reorganization that pursuant to the provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code (Title 11 of the
				  United States Code) has been confirmed or is subject to confirmation by the decree or order of a court of competent jurisdiction.SEC. 30. Section 25248 of the Corporations Code is amended to read:25248. (a) If the commissioner finds, as a result of any examination or investigation or from any report made to the commissioner, that any person subject to this part, other than an investment adviser subject to Section 25230.1, is in an insolvent condition, or is conducting a securities, broker-dealer, or investment advisory business in such an unsafe, injurious, or unauthorized manner as to render further operations hazardous to the public or to customers, the commissioner may, by an order addressed to and served by registered or certified mail or by personal service on that person and on any other person having in his or her possession or control any client funds, trust funds, or other property deposited with that person, direct discontinuance of the disbursement of client or trust funds by
