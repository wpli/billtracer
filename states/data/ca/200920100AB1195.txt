											  Child care and development programs: advisory committee.The Child Care and Development Services Act, administered by the State Department of Education, requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to administer child care and development programs, which offer a full range of services for children from infancy to 13 years of age who are eligible for child care and developmental services. Existing law requires the Governor to appoint an advisory committee to assist the State Department of Education in developing a state plan for child development programs pursuant to that act. This bill would require the advisory committee to assist the department in the development of a plan to implement any new federal grant funds made available after March 1, 2009, for child care and development programs and early childhood education.
