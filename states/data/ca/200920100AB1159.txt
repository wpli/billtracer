SEC. 2. (a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following: (1) That the enactment of Assembly Bill 32 (Chapter 488, Statutes of 2006) made California a national and global policy leader in the effort to reduce greenhouse gases that pose serious threats to our natural environment and to our residents’ health and safety.(2) That the prospect of global warming is very real and may already be impacting our climate and ecosystems.(3) That there is an urgent need to develop, market, and use products, equipment, and services that reduce the formation of greenhouse gases.(b) The Legislature further finds and declares:(1) That the level of national and global concern over greenhouse gas emissions has begun to focus American technological research and investment on developing industrial and consumer products and processes that produce zero or ultra-low emissions of carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas.(2) It is in the best interest of this state to expeditiously foster a competitive cleantech industry in California by offering investors financial incentives to spur cleantech research and development, production, and utilization of environmentally clean products.(3) That Cleantech Venture reached eight billion four hundred million dollars ($8,400,000,000) in 2008.(4) That growing cleantech investment will help create as many as 114,000 new, high-paying, skilled jobs, improve the state’s air and water quality, and offer businesses reliable and affordable sources of alternative energy.(c) Therefore, it is the intent of the Legislature to enact and enhance targeted tax credits to increase investment in cleantech activities and renewable energy, as well as maintain and enhance this state’s competitive lead in attracting investment capital, clean industry, and high-paying, skilled jobs.
