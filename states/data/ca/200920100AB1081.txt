						TorricoFebruary 27, 2009 An act to amend Sections 273.6, 646.94, and 1203.097 of the Penal Code, relating to electronic monitoring. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1081, as amended, Torrico.
											  Electronic monitoring: domestic violence.Existing law makes it either a misdemeanor or a felony for a person to violate restraining orders relating to domestic violence, as specified. This bill would require the court to order, prior to sentencing, the probation department to administer a risk assessment evaluation when a person is convicted of violating a restraining order as part of the presentence report. This bill would require the court to impose continuous electronic surveillance of the person using specified GPS technology if the court determines that the results of the risk assessment and any other relevant conditions merit the order, as specified. The bill
		would also require the defendant to pay for the costs of the monitoring if he or she is able and would require the court to impose a $200 fee upon conviction, if the defendant is able to pay the fee, as specified.Existing law establishes a program of intense parole supervision for persons released on parole after a term of imprisonment because of a conviction for stalking.This bill would include in that program a requirement that the parolee be continuously monitored using specified GPS technology. This bill would require the parolee to pay for the costs of the monitoring unless he or she does not have the ability to pay, as specified.Existing law establishes specific conditions of probation for persons convicted of domestic violence, as specified.This bill would require the court to order, as a condition of probation for a person
		convicted of domestic violence, as defined, continuous electronic surveillance using specified GPS technology if the court determines that the results of a risk assessment evaluation and any other relevant conditions merit the order, as specified. This bill would also require the probationer to pay for the costs associated with the monitoring if he or she is able, as specified.Because this bill would increase the duties of certain local officials, it would impose a state-mandated local programThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates
		no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.The California Constitution provides for the Right to Truth in Evidence, which requires a 2/3 vote of the Legislature to exclude any relevant evidence from any criminal proceeding, as specified.Because this bill would exclude evidence of crimes other than restraining order violations that is obtained from the GPS surveillance authorized by this bill from criminal
		proceedings, it requires a 2/3 vote of the Legislature.Digest Key

                                YES  Bill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. Section 273.6 of the Penal Code is amended to read:273.6. (a) Any intentional and knowing violation of a protective order, as defined in Section 6218 of the Family Code, or of an order issued pursuant to Section 527.6 or 527.8 of the Code of Civil Procedure, or Section 15657.03 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000), or by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year, or by both that fine and imprisonment.(b) In the event of a violation of subdivision (a) which results in physical injury, the person shall be punished by a fine of not more than two thousand dollars ($2,000), or by imprisonment in a county jail for not less than 30 days nor more than one year, or by both that fine and
				  imprisonment. However, if the person is imprisoned in a county jail for at least 48 hours, the court may, in the interest of justice and for reasons stated on the record, reduce or eliminate the 30-day minimum imprisonment required by this subdivision. In determining whether to reduce or eliminate the minimum imprisonment pursuant to this subdivision, the court shall consider the seriousness of the facts before the court, whether there are additional allegations of a violation of the order during the pendency of the case before the court, the probability of future violations, the safety of the victim, and whether the defendant has successfully completed or is making progress with counseling.(c) Subdivisions (a) and (b) shall apply to the following court orders:(1) Any order issued pursuant to Section 6320 or 6389 of the Family Code.(2) An order excluding one party from the family dwelling or from the dwelling of the other.(3) An order enjoining a party from specified behavior which the court determined was necessary to effectuate the order described in subdivision (a).(4) Any order issued by another state that is recognized under Part 5 (commencing with Section 6400) of Division 10 of the Family Code.(d) A subsequent conviction for a violation of an order described in subdivision (a), occurring within seven years of a prior conviction for a violation of an order described in subdivision (a) and involving an act of violence or “a credible threat” of violence, as defined in subdivision (c) of Section 139, is punishable by imprisonment in a county jail not to exceed one year, or in the
				  state prison.(e) In the event of a subsequent conviction for a violation of an order described in subdivision (a) for an act occurring within one year of a prior conviction for a violation of an order described in subdivision (a) that results in physical injury to a victim, the person shall be punished by a fine of not more than two thousand dollars ($2,000), or by imprisonment in a county jail for not less than six months nor more than one year, by both that fine and imprisonment, or by imprisonment in the state prison. However, if the person is imprisoned in a county jail for at least 30 days, the court may, in the interest of justice and for reasons stated in the record, reduce or eliminate the six-month minimum imprisonment required by this subdivision. In determining whether to reduce or eliminate the minimum imprisonment pursuant to this subdivision, the court shall consider the seriousness of the facts before the court, whether there
				  are additional allegations of a violation of the order during the pendency of the case before the court, the probability of future violations, the safety of the victim, and whether the defendant has successfully completed or is making progress with counseling.(f) (1) Whenever a person is convicted of violating subdivision (a), (b), (d), or (e), the court shall order the probation department, in partnership with a licensed mental health professional, to administer a mandatory risk assessment evaluation as part of its presentence report prior to sentencing. If the court determines that the results of the risk assessment and any
				  other relevant circumstances of the violation, including any statement from the victim relating to the necessity of the use of the surveillance authorized by this subdivision, merit the order, the court shall order that the person be placed under continuous electronic surveillance using GPS technology, as specified in paragraph (2) (3), as a term of probation, parole, or any other conditional release from custody.(2) No evidence of a crime unrelated to a violation of the underlying restraining order shall be admissible in any criminal proceeding if it was obtained from or through any continuous
				  electronic surveillance imposed pursuant to this subdivision.(2)(3) The GPS technology used to electronically monitor the defendant, when imposed pursuant to this subdivision, shall be the best available technology for tracking domestic violence offenders. The technology shall be capable of all of the following:(A) Immediately notifying law enforcement or any other responsible monitoring agency when the defendant is in a location prohibited by an order of the court.(B) Immediately notifying the victim when the defendant is in a location prohibited by an order of the
				  court.(C) Allowing monitors to speak to the offender through a cell phone implanted in the bracelet device.(D) Activating a loud alarm to warn the victim of the offender’s presence in a prohibited location.(3)(4) The offender shall be required to pay for the costs associated with any monitoring required pursuant to paragraph (1) unless the court or the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation finds that the offender does not have the ability to pay for those costs.(4)(5) In addition to any other fine or fee, the court shall order the defendant to pay a two hundred dollar ($200) fee upon conviction of a violation of subdivision (a), (b), (d), or (e), unless the court finds that the defendant does not have the ability to pay this fee. Notwithstanding Section 1463 or 1464, the money collected by a county from the imposition of this fee shall be deposited into that county’s domestic violence surveillance fund, a special account that shall be established in each county. The money in that fund shall be used to pay for the GPS program established in this subdivision and for any reasonable administrative costs of the county for the administration of this fund.(f)(g) The prosecuting agency of each county shall have the primary responsibility for the enforcement of orders described in subdivisions (a), (b), (d), and (e).(g)(h) (1) Every person who owns, possesses, purchases, or receives a firearm knowing he or she is prohibited from doing so by the provisions of a protective order as defined in Section 136.2 of this code, Section 6218 of the Family Code, or Section 527.6 or 527.8 of the Code of Civil Procedure, or Section 15657.03 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, shall be punished under the provisions of subdivision (g) of Section 12021.(2) Every person subject to a protective order
				  described in paragraph (1) shall not be prosecuted under this section for owning, possessing, purchasing, or receiving a firearm to the extent that firearm is granted an exemption pursuant to subdivision (f) of Section 527.9 of the Code of Civil Procedure, or subdivision (h) of Section 6389 of the Family Code.(h)(i) If probation is granted upon conviction of a violation of subdivision (a), (b), (c), (d), or (e), the court shall impose probation consistent with the provisions of Section 1203.097, and the conditions of probation may include, in lieu of a fine, one or both of the following requirements:(1) That the defendant make payments to a battered women’s
				  shelter or to a shelter for abused elder persons or dependent adults, up to a maximum of five thousand dollars ($5,000), pursuant to Section 1203.097.(2) That the defendant reimburse the victim for reasonable costs of counseling and other reasonable expenses that the court finds are the direct result of the defendant’s offense.(i)(j) For any order to pay a fine, make payments to a battered women’s shelter, or pay restitution as a condition of probation under subdivision (e), the court shall make a determination of the defendant’s ability to pay. In no event shall any order to make payments to a battered women’s shelter be made if it would impair the ability of
				  the defendant to pay direct restitution to the victim or court-ordered child support. Where the injury to a married person is caused in whole or in part by the criminal acts of his or her spouse in violation of this section, the community property may not be used to discharge the liability of the offending spouse for restitution to the injured spouse, required by Section 1203.04, as operative on or before August 2, 1995, or Section 1202.4, or to a shelter for costs with regard to the injured spouse and dependents, required by this section, until all separate property of the offending spouse is exhausted.SEC. 2. Section 646.94 of the Penal Code is amended to read:646.94. (a) Contingent upon a Budget Act appropriation, the Department of Corrections shall ensure that any parolee convicted of violating Section 646.9 on or after January 1, 2002, who is deemed to pose a high risk of committing a repeat stalking offense be placed on an intensive and specialized parole supervision program for a period not to exceed the period of parole.(b) (1) The program shall include referral to specialized services, for example substance abuse treatment, for offenders needing those specialized services.(2) Parolees participating in this program shall be required to participate in relapse prevention classes as a condition of
				  parole.(3) Parole agents may conduct group counseling sessions as part of the program.(4) The department may include other appropriate offenders in the treatment program if doing so facilitates the effectiveness of the treatment program.(5) (A) The program shall also require that the parolee be placed under continuous electronic surveillance through GPS technology, as specified in paragraph (2) (3) of subdivision (f) of Section 273.6. The parolee shall be required to pay for the costs associated
				  with the required monitoring unless the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation finds that the parolee does not have the ability to pay for those costs.(B) No evidence of a crime unrelated to a violation of any underlying restraining order shall be admissible in any criminal proceeding if it was obtained from or through any continuous electronic surveillance imposed pursuant to this subdivision.(c) The program shall be established with the assistance and supervision of the staff of the department primarily by obtaining the services of mental health providers specializing in the treatment of stalking patients. Each parolee placed into this program shall be required to participate in clinical counseling programs aimed at reducing the likelihood that the parolee will commit or attempt to commit acts of
				  violence or stalk their victim.(d) The department may require persons subject to this section to pay some or all of the costs associated with this treatment, subject to the person’s ability to pay. “Ability to pay” means the overall capability of the person to reimburse the costs, or a portion of the costs, of providing mental health treatment, and shall include, but shall not be limited to, consideration of all of the following factors:(1) Present financial position.(2) Reasonably discernible future financial position.(3) Likelihood that the person shall be able to obtain employment after the date of parole.(4) Any other factor or factors that may bear upon the person’s financial

				  including, but not limited to, the recidivism rate for repeat stalking related offenses committed by persons placed into the program and a cost-benefit analysis of the program.(h) This section shall become operative upon the appropriation of sufficient funds in the Budget Act to implement this section.SEC. 3. Section 1203.097 of the Penal Code, as amended by Section 43 of Chapter 483 of the Statutes of 2007, is amended to read:1203.097. (a) If a person is granted probation for a crime in which the victim is a person defined in Section 6211 of the Family Code, the terms of probation shall include all of the following:(1) A minimum period of probation of 36 months, which may include a period of summary probation as appropriate.(2) A criminal court protective order protecting the victim from further acts of violence, threats, stalking, sexual abuse, and harassment, and, if appropriate, containing residence exclusion or stay-away conditions.(3) Notice to the victim of the disposition of the case.(4) Booking the defendant within one week of sentencing if the defendant has not already been booked.(5) A minimum payment by the defendant of two hundred dollars ($200) to be disbursed as specified in this paragraph.

The remainder shall be transferred, once a month, to the Controller for deposit in equal
				  amounts in the Domestic Violence Restraining Order Reimbursement Fund and in the Domestic Violence Training and Education Fund, which are hereby created, in an amount equal to two-thirds of funds collected during the preceding month. Moneys deposited into these funds pursuant to this section shall be available upon appropriation by the Legislature and shall be distributed each fiscal year as follows:(A) Funds from the Domestic Violence Restraining Order Reimbursement Fund shall be distributed to local law enforcement or other criminal justice agencies for state-mandated local costs resulting from the notification requirements set forth in subdivision (b) of Section 6380 of the Family Code, based on the annual notification from the Department of Justice of the number of restraining orders issued and registered in the state domestic violence restraining order registry maintained by the Department of Justice, for the development and maintenance
				  of the domestic violence restraining order databank system.(B) Funds from the Domestic Violence Training and Education Fund shall support a statewide training and education program to increase public awareness of domestic violence and to improve the scope and quality of services provided to the victims of domestic violence. Grants to support this program shall be awarded on a competitive basis and be administered by the State Department of Public Health, in consultation with the statewide domestic violence coalition, which is eligible to receive funding under this section.(6) Successful completion of a batterer’s program, as defined in subdivision (c), or if none is available, another appropriate counseling program designated by the court, for a period not less than one year with periodic progress reports by the program to the court every three months or less and weekly sessions
				  of a minimum of two hours class time duration. The defendant shall attend consecutive weekly sessions, unless granted an excused absence for good cause by the program for no more than three individual sessions during the entire program, and shall complete the program within 18 months, unless, after a hearing, the court finds good cause to modify the requirements of consecutive attendance or completion within 18 months.(7) (A) (i) The court shall order the defendant to comply with all probation requirements, including the requirements to attend counseling, keep all program appointments, and pay program fees based upon the ability to pay.(ii) The terms of probation for offenders shall not be lifted until all reasonable fees due to the counseling program have been paid in full, but in no case shall probation be extended beyond the term
				  provided in subdivision (a) of Section 1203.1. If the court finds that the defendant does not have the ability to pay the fees based on the defendant’s changed circumstances, the court may reduce or waive the fees.(B) Upon request by the batterer’s program, the court shall provide the defendant’s arrest report, prior incidents of violence, and treatment history to the program.(8) The court also shall order the defendant to perform a specified amount of appropriate community service, as designated by the court. The defendant shall present the court with proof of completion of community service and the court shall determine if the community service has been satisfactorily completed. If sufficient staff and resources are available, the community service shall be performed under the jurisdiction of the local agency overseeing a community service program.(9) If the program finds that the defendant is unsuitable, the program shall immediately contact the probation department or the court. The probation department or court shall either recalendar the case for hearing or refer the defendant to an appropriate alternative batterer’s program.(10) (A) Upon recommendation of the program, a court shall require a defendant to participate in additional sessions throughout the probationary period, unless it finds that it is not in the interests of justice to do so, states its reasons on the record, and enters them into the minutes. In deciding whether the defendant would benefit from more sessions, the court shall consider whether any of the following conditions exist:(i) The defendant has been violence free for a minimum of six months.(ii) The defendant has cooperated and participated in the batterer’s program.(iii) The defendant demonstrates an understanding of and practices positive conflict resolution skills.(iv) The defendant blames, degrades, or has committed acts that dehumanize the victim or puts at risk the victim’s safety, including, but not limited to, molesting, stalking, striking, attacking, threatening, sexually assaulting, or battering the victim.(v) The defendant demonstrates an understanding that the use of coercion or violent behavior to maintain dominance is unacceptable in an intimate relationship.(vi) The defendant has made threats to harm anyone in any manner.(vii) The defendant has complied with applicable requirements under paragraph (6) of subdivision (c) or subparagraph (C) to receive alcohol counseling, drug counseling, or both.(viii) The defendant demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for the abusive behavior perpetrated against the victim.(B) The program shall immediately report any violation of the terms of the protective order, including any new acts of violence or failure to comply with the program requirements, to the court, the prosecutor, and, if formal probation has been ordered, to the probation department. The probationer shall file proof of enrollment in a batterer’s program with the court within 30 days of conviction.(C) Concurrent with other requirements under this section, in addition
				  to, and not in lieu of, the batterer’s program, and unless prohibited by the referring court, the probation department or the court may make provisions for a defendant to use his or her resources to enroll in a chemical dependency program or to enter voluntarily a licensed chemical dependency recovery hospital or residential treatment program that has a valid license issued by the state to provide alcohol or drug services to receive program participation credit, as determined by the court. The probation department shall document evidence of this hospital or residential treatment participation in the defendant’s program file.(11) The conditions of probation may include, in lieu of a fine, but not in lieu of the fund payment required under paragraph (5), one or more of the following requirements:(A) That the defendant make payments to a battered women’s shelter, up to a maximum of
				  five thousand dollars ($5,000).(B) That the defendant reimburse the victim for reasonable expenses that the court finds are the direct result of the defendant’s offense.For any order to pay a fine, to make payments to a battered women’s shelter, or to pay restitution as a condition of probation under this subdivision, the court shall make a determination of the defendant’s ability to pay. Determination of a defendant’s ability to pay may include his or her future earning capacity. A defendant shall bear the burden of demonstrating lack of his or her ability to pay. Express findings by the court as to the factors bearing on the amount of the fine shall not be required. In no event shall any order to make payments to a battered women’s shelter be made if it would impair the ability of the defendant to pay direct restitution to the victim or court-ordered child support. When the injury to a married
				  person is caused, in whole or in part, by the criminal acts of his or her spouse in violation of this section, the community property shall not be used to discharge the liability of the offending spouse for restitution to the injured spouse, as required by Section 1203.04, as operative on or before August 2, 1995, or Section 1202.4, or to a shelter for costs with regard to the injured spouse, until all separate property of the offending spouse is exhausted.(12) If it appears to the prosecuting attorney, the court, or the probation department that the defendant is performing unsatisfactorily in the assigned program, is not benefiting from counseling, or has engaged in criminal conduct, upon request of the probation officer, the prosecuting attorney, or on its own motion, the court, as a priority calendar item, shall hold a hearing to determine whether further sentencing should proceed. The court may consider factors, including, but not limited
				  to, any violence by the defendant against the former or a new victim while on probation and noncompliance with any other specific condition of probation. If the court finds that the defendant is not performing satisfactorily in the assigned program, is not benefiting from the program, has not complied with a condition of probation, or has engaged in criminal conduct, the court shall terminate the defendant’s participation in the program and shall proceed with further sentencing.(b) If a person is granted formal probation for a crime in which the victim is a person defined in Section 6211 of the Family Code, in addition to the terms specified in subdivision (a), all of the following shall apply:(1) The probation department shall make an investigation and take into consideration the defendant’s age, medical history, employment and service records, educational background, community
				  and family ties, prior incidents of violence, police report, treatment history, if any, demonstrable motivation, and other mitigating factors in determining which batterer’s program would be appropriate for the defendant. This information shall be provided to the batterer’s program if it is requested. The probation department shall also determine which community programs the defendant would benefit from and which of those programs would accept the defendant. The probation department shall report its findings and recommendations to the court.(2) The court shall advise the defendant that the failure to report to the probation department for the initial investigation, as directed by the court, or the failure to enroll in a specified program, as directed by the court or the probation department, shall result in possible further incarceration. The court, in the interests of justice, may relieve the defendant from the prohibition set forth in this
				  subdivision based upon the defendant’s mistake or excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall be filed within 20 court days of the missed deadline. This time limitation may not be extended. A copy of any application for relief shall be served on the office of the prosecuting attorney.(3) After the court orders the defendant to a batterer’s program, the probation department shall conduct an initial assessment of the defendant, including, but not limited to, all of the following:(A) Social, economic, and family background.(B) Education.(C) Vocational achievements.(D) Criminal history.(E) Medical history.(F) Substance abuse history.(G) Consultation with the probation officer.(H) Verbal consultation with the victim, only if the victim desires to participate.(I) Assessment of the future probability of the defendant committing murder.(4) The probation department shall attempt to notify the victim regarding the requirements for the defendant’s participation in the batterer’s program, as well as regarding available victim resources. The victim also shall be informed that attendance in any program does not guarantee that an abuser will not be violent.(c) The court or the probation department shall refer defendants only to
				  batterer’s programs that follow standards outlined in paragraph (1), which may include, but are not limited to, lectures, classes, group discussions, and counseling. The probation department shall design and implement an approval and renewal process for batterer’s programs and shall solicit input from criminal justice agencies and domestic violence victim advocacy programs.(1) The goal of a batterer’s program under this section shall be to stop domestic violence. A batterer’s program shall consist of the following components:(A) Strategies to hold the defendant accountable for the violence in a relationship, including, but not limited to, providing the defendant with a written statement that the defendant shall be held accountable for acts or threats of domestic violence.(B) A requirement that the defendant
				  participate in ongoing same-gender group sessions.(C) An initial intake that provides written definitions to the defendant of physical, emotional, sexual, economic, and verbal abuse, and the techniques for stopping these types of abuse.(D) Procedures to inform the victim regarding the requirements for the defendant’s participation in the intervention program as well as regarding available victim resources. The victim also shall be informed that attendance in any program does not guarantee that an abuser will not be violent.(E) A requirement that the defendant attend group sessions free of chemical influence.(F) Educational programming that examines, at a minimum, gender roles, socialization, the nature of violence, the dynamics of power and control,
				  and the effects of abuse on children and others.(G) A requirement that excludes any couple counseling or family counseling, or both.(H) Procedures that give the program the right to assess whether or not the defendant would benefit from the program and to refuse to enroll the defendant if it is determined that the defendant would not benefit from the program, so long as the refusal is not because of the defendant’s inability to pay. If possible, the program shall suggest an appropriate alternative program.(I) Program staff who, to the extent possible, have specific knowledge regarding, but not limited to, spousal abuse, child abuse, sexual abuse, substance abuse, the dynamics of violence and abuse, the law, and procedures of the legal system.(J) Program staff who are encouraged to utilize the expertise, training, and assistance of local domestic violence centers.(K) A requirement that the defendant enter into a written agreement with the program, which shall include an outline of the contents of the program, the attendance requirements, the requirement to attend group sessions free of chemical influence, and a statement that the defendant may be removed from the program if it is determined that the defendant is not benefiting from the program or is disruptive to the program.(L) A requirement that the defendant sign a confidentiality statement prohibiting disclosure of any information obtained through participating in the program or during group sessions regarding other participants in the program.(M) Program content that provides cultural
				  and ethnic sensitivity.(N) A requirement of a written referral from the court or probation department prior to permitting the defendant to enroll in the program. The written referral shall state the number of minimum sessions required by the court.(O) Procedures for submitting to the probation department all of the following uniform written responses:(i) Proof of enrollment, to be submitted to the court and the probation department and to include the fee determined to be charged to the defendant, based upon the ability to pay, for each session.(ii) Periodic progress reports that include attendance, fee payment history, and program compliance.(iii) Final evaluation that includes the
				  program’s evaluation of the defendant’s progress, using the criteria set forth in paragraph (4) of subdivision (a) and recommendation for either successful or unsuccessful termination or continuation in the program.(P) A sliding fee schedule based on the defendant’s ability to pay. The batterer’s program shall develop and utilize a sliding fee scale that recognizes both the defendant’s ability to pay and the necessity of programs to meet overhead expenses. An indigent defendant may negotiate a deferred payment schedule, but shall pay a nominal fee, if the defendant has the ability to pay the nominal fee. Upon a hearing and a finding by the court that the defendant does not have the financial ability to pay the nominal fee, the court shall waive this fee. The payment of the fee shall be made a condition of probation if the court determines the defendant has the present ability to pay the fee. The fee shall be paid during the term of probation
				  unless the program sets other conditions. The acceptance policies shall be in accordance with the scaled fee system.(2) The court shall refer persons only to batterer’s programs that have been approved by the probation department pursuant to paragraph (5). The probation department shall do both of the following:(A) Provide for the issuance of a provisional approval, provided that the applicant is in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and an urgent need for approval exists. A provisional approval shall be considered an authorization to provide services and shall not be considered a vested right.(B) If the probation department determines that a program is not in compliance with standards set by the department, the department shall provide written notice of the noncompliant areas to the
				  program. The program shall submit a written plan of corrections within 14 days from the date of the written notice on noncompliance. A plan of correction shall include, but not be limited to, a description of each corrective action and timeframe for implementation. The department shall review and approve all or any part of the plan of correction and notify the program of approval or disapproval in writing. If the program fails to submit a plan of correction or fails to implement the approved plan of correction, the department shall consider whether to revoke or suspend approval and, upon revoking or suspending approval, shall have the option to cease referrals of defendants under this section.(3) No program, regardless of its source of funding, shall be approved unless it meets all of the following standards:(A) The establishment of guidelines and criteria for education
				  services, including standards of services that may include lectures, classes, and group discussions.(B) Supervision of the defendant for the purpose of evaluating the person’s progress in the program.(C) Adequate reporting requirements to ensure that all persons who, after being ordered to attend and complete a program, may be identified for either failure to enroll in, or failure to successfully complete, the program or for the successful completion of the program as ordered. The program shall notify the court and the probation department, in writing, within the period of time and in the manner specified by the court of any person who fails to complete the program. Notification shall be given if the program determines that the defendant is performing unsatisfactorily or if the defendant is not benefiting from the education, treatment, or counseling.(D) No victim shall be compelled to participate in a program or counseling, and no program may condition a defendant’s enrollment on participation by the victim.(4) In making referrals of indigent defendants to approved batterer’s programs, the probation department shall apportion these referrals evenly among the approved programs.(5) The probation department shall have the sole authority to approve a batterer’s program for probation. The program shall be required to obtain only one approval but shall renew that approval annually.(A) The procedure for the approval of a new or existing program shall include all of the following:(i) The completion of a written application containing
