						FeuerFebruary 27, 2009 An act to amend Section 3426.7 of the Civil Code, relating to trade secrets. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1446, as introduced, Feuer.
											  Trade secrets: disclosure by public agencies.The Uniform Trade Secrets Act establishes specified remedies for the misappropriation of a trade secret. The act provides that its provisions do not affect the disclosure of a record by a state or local agency under the California Public Records Act, which requires state and local agencies to make their records available for public inspection, unless an exemption applies, and to make copies available upon payment of specified fees.This bill would establish a procedure to be applied when a person or entity submits any record or information to a state agency that the person or entity has designated as a trade secret. The bill would require the person or entity to submit documentary support for that designation to the agency to which the record or information is submitted and, if the agency concurs in the designation, would provide that the record or information shall be exempt from disclosure. The bill would provide that the fact that the record or
		information is exempt from disclosure shall be a public record subject to disclosure.Digest Key
