						Wolk)February 27, 2009An act to amend Section 4648.4 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to developmental services. An act to amend Section 56366.10 of the Education Code, relating to special education.LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1296, as amended, Blumenfield.
											  Developmental services: regional centers. Special education: nonpublic, nonsectarian schools.Existing law requires that services provided by nonpublic, nonsectarian schools and agencies be made available to local educational agencies and parents for the purpose of providing alternative special education services to individuals with exceptional needs. Existing law requires a nonpublic, nonsectarian school that provides special education and related services to an individual with exceptional needs to certify in writing to the Superintendent of Public Instruction that the school satisfies various requirements, including, among others, that it will not accept a pupil with exceptional needs if it cannot provide or ensure the provision of the services outlined in the pupil’s individualized education program (IEP).This bill would revise that requirement regarding pupil acceptance to allow a nonpublic, nonsectarian school to accept a pupil if
		the local educational agency and the parent or guardian of the pupil agree that the pupil may be accepted when, on a temporary basis, the nonpublic, nonsectarian school cannot provide one or more of the services outlined in the pupil’s IEP due to a shortage of qualified professionals.Under existing law, the State Department of Developmental Services provides funding for regional centers for the provision or purchase of services and supports to persons with developmental disabilities. Existing law, with certain exceptions, prohibits a regional center from paying any provider of specified services a rate that is greater than the rate that is in effect on June 30, 2008, unless the increase is required by contract between the regional center and the vendor that is in effect on June 30, 2008.This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to the above provisions.Digest Key
