						LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1390, Blumenfield.
											  School safety: school security and police departments.(1) Existing law requires the principal of a school or the principal’s designee to notify the appropriate law enforcement agencies of the county or city in which the school is situated of certain unlawful acts committed by a pupil that may result in suspension, expulsion, or criminal liability of the pupil, as specified.This bill would require a school principal or the principal’s designee to report any act involving either the possession, sale, or furnishment of a firearm, as specified, or the possession of an explosive, as specified, committed by a pupil or nonpupil on a schoolsite to the city police or county sheriff with jurisdiction over the school and the school security department or the school police department, as applicable.By requiring school principals or their designees to perform additional duties, this bill would impose a state-mandated
		local program.(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.Digest Key
