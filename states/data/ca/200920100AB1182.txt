						LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1182, Brownley.
											  Public postsecondary education: reporting requirements.(1) Existing law establishes the various segments of the higher education system in the state. These segments include the University of California, which is administered by the Regents of the University of California, the California State University, which is administered by the Trustees of the California State University, and the California Community Colleges, which is administered by the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, which together comprise the public postsecondary education system.This bill would express the intent of the Legislature to refine higher education reporting requirements to provide for more effective, manageable, and transparent reporting by the higher education segments.(2) Existing law contains various reporting requirements of the University of California, the California State University, and the California Community Colleges both in statute and in Supplemental Report language to the annual Budget Act.The bill would codify these requirements by requesting the University of California, and requiring the California State University and the California Community Colleges, to report to the Legislature on institutional financial aid, campus enrollment and facilities, academic and research programs, and the capital outlay planning process, as specified. The bill would make conforming changes. The bill would
		additionally revise the deadlines for the submittal of reports by the University of California, the California State University, and the California Community Colleges.(3) Existing law requires the trustees and the board of governors to establish and convene a task force to develop a plan for integrating instruction in business ethics into their business and business administration programs and to submit a diversity paper concerning its own membership.The bill would delete these requirements.(4) Existing law requires the Trustees of the California State University and requests the Regents of the University of California to biennially report on state-funded services for students with disabilities.The bill would delete this requirement and this request.(5) Existing law requires the board of
		governors, every 3 years, to develop and submit a diversity paper concerning its own membership.The bill would delete this requirement.(6) Existing law requests the Regents of the University of California to establish the Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program to support competitive grants to promote more research and education on sustainable agricultural practices, and to support the giving of instructions and practical demonstrations in agriculture. Existing law also provides for a program of demonstration projects designed to provide extension services, training, and financial incentives for participating farmers to implement biologically integrated farming systems.This bill would repeal the provisions providing for those programs.(7) Existing law creates the California State University, Channel Islands Site Authority, contingent on the acceptance of the land and improvements comprising the Camarillo State Hospital by the trustees, to be administered by that authority. Existing law requires the trustees, on behalf of the authority, to report to the Legislature and the Governor by July 31 of each year on all expenditures made during the prior fiscal year for facilities of the site.This bill would delete the reporting requirement.Digest Key

Unless otherwise specified, these reports may be submitted in PDF format or comparable electronic format. SEC. 7. Section 66057 of the
		  Education Code is amended to read:66057. (a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:(1) The future economic vitality of California will depend on the state’s ability to educate its citizens and to help them develop the work and social skills needed to compete with workers of other nations and states in our global economy.(2) Ensuring that California’s colleges and universities can accommodate a tidal wave of new students, as well as enable those from diverse backgrounds to achieve success in their college careers, will require a variety of strategies.(3) The Legislative Analyst’s Office (LAO) has reported that most
				  campuses of the University of California, the California State University, and the California Community Colleges will soon exceed their current capacities.(4) The LAO has identified year-round operation as a cost-efficient strategy to address future enrollment growth, by avoiding capital expenditure for instructional space, such as classrooms, class laboratories, study space in libraries, and other selected student support service facilities.(5) Year-round operation also increases student access to high demand campuses, and allows students to accelerate their progress to degrees.(6) (A) It is the intent of the Legislature that the University of California and the California State University accommodate enrollment growth by maximizing the utilization of existing instructional facilities during
				  the summer term before building new classrooms and teaching laboratories. It is further the intent of the Legislature that the University of California and the California State University make requests for capital outlay funding for space for classrooms and class laboratories justified using legislatively approved utilization standards and a reasonable assumption of summer-term enrollment. (B) Accordingly, the University of California is requested to base its annual five-year capital outlay plan on the utilization of instructional facilities during the summer, assuming summer-term enrollment of at least 40 percent of the average fall, winter, and spring enrollment. (C) The California State University is requested to base its annual five-year capital outlay plan on utilization of instructional facilities during the
				  summer, assuming summer-term enrollment of at least 25 percent and 40 percent of the fall, winter, spring enrollment at rural and urban campuses, respectively. (b) Summer session fees at all campuses of the University of California and the California State University shall not exceed the fees charged per credit unit for any other academic term, if the state provides funding to offset any revenue losses that may occur due to the difference between the state university fee and fees charged for self-supporting academic programs.(c) In recognition of the differing circumstances on the various campuses throughout the state, the University of California and the California State University shall retain the flexibility to implement year-round operation differently on individual campuses.(d) On or before January 10 of each year, the University of California is requested to, and the California State University shall, submit to the Legislature a report describing summer enrollment for their respective systems. The report shall include all of the following information separately for each campus in the system: (1) The number of state-funded headcount students enrolled during the summer term of the preceding calendar year and, for comparison purposes, the year-average number of state-funded headcount students enrolled during the preceding fall, winter, and spring terms. (2) The number of state-funded full-time equivalent students enrolled during the summer term of the preceding calendar year and, for comparison purposes, the number of year-average state-funded full-time equivalent students

At a minimum, these systems shall provide for the gathering of outcome data, staff and student perceptions of program effectiveness, and data on the implementation of the program and physical accessibility requirements of Section 794 of Title 29 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973.(b) Commencing in January 1990, and every two years thereafter, the Board of Governors of the
				  California Community Colleges shall submit a report to the Governor, the education policy committees of the Legislature, and the California Postsecondary Education Commission describing its efforts to serve students with disabilities. These biennial reports shall also include a review on a campus-by-campus basis of the enrollment, retention, transition, and graduation rates of disabled students, including categorical funding of those programs.SEC. 10. Section 67501 is added to the Education Code, to read:67501. (a) The University of California may, and the California State University shall, submit to the Legislature on or before November 30 of each year a comprehensive five-year capital outlay plan that includes, but is not limited to, all of the following information:(1) State and nonstate projects proposed for each campus in each year of the plan, including a discussion of the programmatic bases for each project.(2) An explanation of how each project contributes to accommodating needs associated with current or projected enrollments of graduate and undergraduate students, and other needs, and the rough estimates of the costs of meeting those needs.(3) The estimated costs of each project, showing the schedule for when these funds will be needed, including a schedule of annual funding needs beyond the five years for those projects for which completion exceeds the timeframe of the plan and the relative priority on a campus and statewide basis.(4) An explanation of how the plan addresses the Legislature’s intent that the universities annually consider, as part of their annual capital outlay planning process, the inclusion of facilities that may be used by more than one segment of public higher education (intersegmental).(5) Description and costs of activities that take place within the plan’s timeframe related to the planning or establishment of new campuses.(b) The California Community Colleges
				  Chancellor’s office shall prepare a five-year capital outlay plan identifying the statewide needs and priorities of the California Community Colleges. This plan shall be submitted to the Legislature on or before November 30 of each year. It is the intent of the Legislature not to consider any community college capital outlay project that is not included in the statewide five-year plan submitted to the Legislature. The five-year capital outlay plan shall include, but not be limited to, all of the following information:(1) Enrollment projections for each community college district.(2) Projects proposed for each campus in each year of the plan.(3) The estimated costs of each project, showing the schedule for when these funds will be needed and the relative priority on a statewide basis.(4) An explanation of the Chancellor’s office priorities and methodology for selecting projects for state capital outlay funding.(5) An explanation of the Chancellor’s office methodology for calculating unmet capital outlay needs for the community college system.(6) An explanation of how the plan addresses the Legislature’s intent that the community colleges annually consider, as part of their annual capital outlay planning process, the inclusion of facilities that may be used by more than one segment of public higher education (intersegmental).(c) The plans for the University of California, the California State University, and the California Community Colleges shall be updated annually, taking into consideration evolving circumstances in the planning process of the institutions. The Legislature recognizes that the annual plan is a
				  flexible, working document subject to the evolutionary change inherent in the planning process. The plan shall be designed to reflect project data changes on a year-to-year basis, and the inclusion of a project in the plan does not guarantee its viability. It is further the intent of the Legislature that the project planning guides or capital outlay budget change proposals submitted for each state-funded project proposed for inclusion in the first year of the plan specify both of the following:(1) How each project meets needs
				  for different types of space, including, but not limited to, classrooms, teaching laboratories, research laboratories, and faculty offices.(2) The direct and indirect project costs associated with the different types of space.SEC. 11. Section 67502 is added to the Education Code, to read:67502. (a) On or before November 1 of each year, the Regents of the University of California are requested to provide to the Joint Legislative Budget Committee and the Department of Finance a summary of all instructional and research space in the university system.

Although not on target to meet the goal of achieving a 75-percent reduction in tobacco consumption in California by the year 1999, the results are encouraging.(2) The Legislature further finds that as a result of the success of the programs, the money received from the taxation of tobacco has been dropping. The Legislature declares this a sign of success, not a matter of concern.(3) The Legislature further notes that programs, organizations, and individuals receiving money from the Cigarette and Tobacco
				  Products Surtax Fund are receiving money from a declining revenue source. The Legislature finds that this success has led to an obvious concern and fear among recipients that “their money” is shrinking every year.(4) The Legislature finds that, assuming the success of the antismoking efforts continue, there will be necessary reductions in spending in the years to come.(5) The Legislature declares its intention to seek full analysis of all programs receiving money under Proposition 99 and declares its intention to critically evaluate how the money is being spent and whether the spending is achieving the results desired.(6) The Legislature specifically rejects the notion that every dollar of expenditure made by every program, organization, or activity is of equal value. Instead, the Legislature declares its
				  intention to choose between competing programs and to allocate moneys to those programs and activities that are most successful in meeting the goals of the initiative.(b) It is the intent of the Legislature to provide for the continuation of the Cigarette and Tobacco Products Surtax Research Program to support research into tobacco-related disease. It is the intent of the Legislature that this program be administered by the University of California and that this program be administered pursuant to the following principles:(1) The research program established should adhere to the objectives stated in the provisions of the initiative act entitled Cigarette and Tobacco Products Surtax regarding research: “The Research Account . . . shall only be available for tobacco-related disease research.”(2) All research funds
				  shall be awarded on the basis of scientific merit as determined by an open, competitive peer review process that assures objectivity, consistency, and high quality. All qualified investigators, regardless of institutional affiliation, shall have equal access and opportunity to compete for the funds in the Research Account.(3) The peer review process for the selection of grants awarded under this program shall be modeled on that used by the National Institutes of Health in its grantmaking process.(4) Awardees shall be reimbursed for the full cost, both direct and indirect, of conducting the sponsored research consistent with federal guidelines governing all federal research grants and contracts.(c) It is further the intent of the Legislature that on or before December 31, 2010, and every five years thereafter, the
				  University of California transmit programmatic, as well as financial, reports to the state, including a report on the grants made, pending grants, program accomplishments, and the future direction of the program. SEC. 30. Section 104530 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:104530. It is the intent of the Legislature that the university, as lead agency, do all of the following:(a) Provide overall direction and coordination of the program.(b) Provide staff assistance to the advisory committee and review panels.(c) Provide for periodic program evaluation, to assure that work funded is consistent with program goals.(d) Maintain a system of financial reporting and accountability.(e) Provide for the systematic dissemination of research results to the public and the
				  health care community, and to provide for a mechanism to disseminate the most current research findings in the areas of smoking cessation and the prevention of tobacco use in order that these findings may be applied to the implementation of the Health Education Account.(f) Develop policies and procedures to facilitate the translation of research results into commercial applications wherever appropriate.(g) Undertake an outreach program to inform interested parties of the availability of grants for public policy research in the area of tobacco control.
