						RuskinFebruary 27, 2009 An act to amend Section 399.20 of the Public Utilities Code, relating to energy. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1023, as amended, Ruskin.
											  Renewable energy resources.Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including electrical corporations, as defined. The Public Utilities Act imposes various duties and responsibilities on the commission with respect to the purchase of electricity by electrical corporations and requires the commission to review and adopt a procurement plan and a renewable energy procurement plan for each electrical corporation pursuant to the California Renewables Portfolio Standard Program. The program requires that a retail seller of electricity, including electrical corporations, purchase a specified minimum percentage of electricity generated by eligible renewable energy resources, as defined, in any given year as a specified percentage of total kilowatthours sold to retail end-use customers each calendar year (renewables portfolio standard).Existing law requires every electrical corporation to file
		with the commission a standard tariff for electricity generated by an electric generation facility, as defined, that is owned and operated by a retail customer of the electrical corporation. Existing law requires, among other things, that the electric generation facility have an effective capacity of not more than 1.5 megawatts and be located on property owned or under the control of the customer.This bill would instead require that the electric generation facility have an effective capacity of not more than 20 10 megawatts and be located on property owned or under the control of the customer. The
		bill would also allow the commission to increase the 10 megawatt capacity limitation up to, and including, a capacity of 15 megawatts.Digest Key

				  the customer.(2) Is interconnected and operates in parallel with the electric transmission and distribution grid.(3) Is strategically located and interconnected to the electric transmission system in a manner that optimizes the deliverability of electricity generated at the facility to load centers.(4) Is an eligible renewable energy resource, as defined in Section 399.12.(c) Every electrical corporation shall file with the commission a standard tariff for electricity generated by an electric generation facility.(d) The tariff shall provide for payment for every kilowatthour of electricity generated by an electric generation facility at the market price as determined by the commission

An electrical corporation may make the terms of the tariff available to customers in the form of a standard contract subject to commission approval. Each electrical corporation shall only be required to offer service or contracts under this section until that electrical corporation meets its proportionate share of the 500 megawatts based on the ratio of its peak demand to the total statewide peak demand of all electrical corporations.(f) Every kilowatthour of electricity generated by the electric generation facility shall count toward the electrical corporation’s renewables portfolio standard annual procurement targets for purposes of paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of Section 399.15.(g) The physical generating capacity of an electric generation facility shall count toward the electrical corporation’s resource adequacy requirement for purposes of Section 380.(h) (1) The commission may modify or adjust the requirements of this section for any electrical corporation with less than 100,000 service connections, as individual circumstances merit.(2) The
				  commission may increase the 10 megawatt capacity limitation of paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) up to, and including, 15 megawatts.
