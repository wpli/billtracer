											  Drugs: adverse effects: reporting.Existing law establishes various programs for the prevention of disease and the promotion of health to be administered by the State Department of Public Health. Existing law also contains provisions for the licensing and regulation of health professionals. Existing law requires the department to regulate the manufacture, sale, labeling, and advertising activities related to food, drugs, devices, and cosmetics in conformity with the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. A violation of these provisions is a crime.This bill would require health professionals, as defined, to report serious adverse drug events, as defined, to the federal Food and Drug Administration and would exempt violations from related
		criminal provisions.Digest Key

                                NO  Bill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:(a) The federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) operates a voluntary reporting system for adverse drug reactions known as the MedWatch system.(b) The FDA currently estimates that only 10 percent of the adverse drug reactions or events that occur each year are reported to the FDA.(c) Given the prevalence of pharmaceuticals and their use for treatment of hundreds of chronic diseases and conditions, and given recent highly publicized instances of commonly used prescription drugs being taken off the market due to safety concerns that were discovered
		  after the drugs were approved for use, the systematic underreporting of adverse drug events represents a serious public health problem.(d) Requiring licensed health professionals to report adverse drug events to the FDA would increase the amount of data available to the FDA about adverse drug reactions, thereby enabling the FDA to discern problems with drugs that arise after they are approved and to take action to protect the public health in a more timely manner.SEC. 2. Article 7 (commencing with Section 111657.10) is added to Chapter 6 of Part 5 of Division 104 of the Health and Safety Code, to read:
