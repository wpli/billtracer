											  Alameda County Hospital Authority. Hospital districts.Existing law authorizes a hospital district to transfer, at fair market value, any part of its assets to one or more nonprofit corporations to operate and maintain the assets. Existing law also authorizes the hospital district to transfer, for the benefit of the communities served by the district, in the absence of adequate consideration, any part of the assets of the district to one or more nonprofit corporations to operate and maintain the assets. Existing law requires, before any transfer of 50% or more of the district’s assets to one or more corporations, a measure proposing the transfer to be submitted to the voters of that district.This bill would provide that the transfers may be made to a county hospital. It would additionally require, before any transfer of an emergency or urgent care department of a general acute care hospital, a
		measure proposing the transfer to be submitted to the voters.Existing law authorizes the Board of Supervisors of the County of Alameda to establish, by ordinance, a hospital authority to manage, administer, and control the Alameda County Medical Center.This bill would provide that the hospital authority is to be established within the county. It would also authorize the hospital authority to impose a special tax, as defined, pursuant to specified provisions of an existing statute.Digest Key

The board of supervisors has further determined that the creation of an independent hospital authority strictly and exclusively dedicated to the management, administration, and control of the medical center, in a manner consistent with the
				  county’s obligations under Section 17000 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, is the best way to fulfill its commitment to the medically indigent, special needs, and general populations of Alameda County. To accomplish this, it is necessary that the board of supervisors be given authority to create a hospital authority. Because there is no general law under which this authority could be formed, the adoption of a special act and the formation of a special authority is required.(2)The following definitions shall apply for purposes of this section:(A)“The county” means the County of Alameda.(B)“Governing board” means the governing body of the hospital authority.(C)“Hospital authority” means the separate public agency established by the Board of
				  Supervisors of Alameda County to manage, administer, and control the Alameda County Medical Center.(D)“Medical center” means the Alameda County Medical Center.(b)The board of supervisors of the county may, by ordinance, establish a hospital authority within the county, but separate and apart from the county, for the purpose of effecting a transfer of the management, administration, and control of the medical center in accordance with Section 14000.2 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. A hospital authority established pursuant to this chapter shall be strictly and exclusively dedicated to the management, administration, and control of the medical center within
				  parameters set forth in this chapter, and in the ordinance, bylaws, and contracts adopted by the board of supervisors which shall not be in conflict with this chapter, Section 1442.5 of this code, or Section 17000 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.(c)A hospital authority established pursuant to this chapter shall be governed by a board that is appointed, both initially and continually, by the Board of Supervisors of the County of Alameda. This hospital authority governing board shall reflect both the expertise necessary to maximize the quality and scope of care at the medical center in a fiscally responsible manner and the diverse interest that the medical center serves. The enabling ordinance shall specify the membership of the hospital authority governing board, the qualifications for individual members, the manner of appointment, selection, or removal of governing board members, their terms of office, and all other matters that the
				  board of supervisors deems necessary or convenient for the conduct of the hospital authority’s activities.(d)The mission of the hospital authority shall be the management, administration, and other control, as determined by the board of supervisors, of the group of public hospitals, clinics, and programs that comprise the medical center, in a manner that ensures appropriate, quality, and cost-effective medical care as required of counties by Section 17000 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, and, to the extent feasible, other populations, including special populations in Alameda County.(e)The board of supervisors shall adopt bylaws for the medical center that set forth those matters related to the operation of the medical center by the hospital authority that the board of supervisors deems necessary and appropriate. The bylaws shall become operative upon approval by a
				  majority vote of the board of supervisors. Any changes or amendments to the bylaws shall be by majority vote of the board of supervisors.(f)The hospital authority created and appointed pursuant to this section is a duly constituted governing body within the meaning of Section 1250 and Section 70035 of Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations as currently written or subsequently amended.(g)Unless otherwise provided by the board of supervisors by way of resolution, the hospital authority is empowered, or the board of supervisors is empowered on behalf of the hospital authority, to apply as a public agency for one or more licenses for the provision of health care pursuant to statutes and regulations governing licensing as currently written or subsequently amended.(h)In the event of a change of license
				  ownership, the governing body of the hospital authority shall comply with the obligations of governing bodies of general acute care hospitals generally as set forth in Section 70701 of Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations, as currently written or subsequently amended, as well as the terms and conditions of the license. The hospital authority shall be the responsible party with respect to compliance with these obligations, terms, and conditions.(i)(1)Any transfer by the county to the hospital authority of the administration, management, and control of the medical center, whether or not the transfer includes the surrendering by the county of the existing general acute care hospital license and corresponding application for a change of ownership of the license, shall not affect the eligibility of the county, or in the case of a change of license ownership, the hospital authority, to do any of the following:(A)Participate in, and receive allocations pursuant to, the California Healthcare for the Indigent Program (CHIP).(B)Receive supplemental reimbursements from the Emergency Services and Supplemental Payments Fund created pursuant to Section 14085.6 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.(C)Receive appropriations from the Medi-Cal Inpatient Payment Adjustment Fund without relieving the county of its obligation to make intergovernmental transfer payments related to the Medi-Cal Inpatient Payment Adjustment Fund pursuant to Section 14163 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.(D)Receive Medi-Cal capital supplements pursuant to Section 14085.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.(E)Receive
				  any other funds that would otherwise be available to a county hospital.(2)Any transfer described in paragraph (1) shall not otherwise disqualify the county, or in the case of a change in license ownership, the hospital authority, from participating in any of the following:(A)Other funding sources either specific to county hospitals or county ambulatory care clinics or for which there are special provisions specific to county hospitals or to county ambulatory care clinics.(B)Funding programs in which the county, on behalf of the medical center and the Alameda County Health Care Services Agency, had participated prior to the creation of the hospital authority, or would otherwise be qualified to participate in had the hospital authority not been created, and administration, management, and control not been
				  transferred by the county to the hospital authority, pursuant to this chapter.(j)A hospital authority created pursuant to this chapter shall be a legal entity separate and apart from the county and shall file the statement required by Section 53051 of the Government Code. The hospital authority shall be a government entity separate and apart from the county, and shall not be considered to be an agency, division, or department of the county. The hospital authority shall not be governed by, nor be subject to, the charter of the county and shall not be subject to policies or operational rules of the county, including, but not limited to, those relating to personnel and procurement.(k)(1)Any contract executed by and between the county and the hospital authority shall provide that liabilities or obligations of the hospital authority with respect to its
				  activities pursuant to the contract shall be the liabilities or obligations of the hospital authority, and shall not become the liabilities or obligations of the county.(2)Any liabilities or obligations of the hospital authority with respect to the liquidation or disposition of the hospital authority’s assets upon termination of the hospital authority shall not become the liabilities or obligations of the county.(3)Any obligation of the hospital authority, statutory, contractual, or otherwise, shall be the obligation solely of the hospital authority and shall not be the obligation of the county or the state.(l)(1)Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any transfer of the administration, management, or assets of the medical center, whether or not accompanied by a
				  change in licensing, shall not relieve the county of the ultimate responsibility for indigent care pursuant to Section 17000 of the Welfare and Institutions Code or any obligation pursuant to Section 1442.5 of this code.(2)Any contract executed by and between the county and the hospital authority shall provide for the indemnification of the county by the hospital authority for liabilities as specifically set forth in the contract, except that the contract shall include a provision that the county shall remain liable for its own negligent acts.(3)Indemnification by the hospital authority shall not be construed as divesting the county from its ultimate responsibility for compliance with Section 17000 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.(m)Notwithstanding the provisions of this section relating to the obligations
				  and liabilities of the hospital authority, a transfer of control or ownership of the medical center shall confer onto the hospital authority all the rights and duties set forth in state law with respect to hospitals owned or operated by a county.(n)(1)A transfer of the maintenance, operation, and management or ownership of the medical center to the hospital authority shall comply with the provisions of Section 14000.2 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.(2)A transfer of maintenance, operation, and management or ownership to the hospital authority may be made with or without the payment of a purchase price by the hospital authority and otherwise upon the terms and conditions that the parties may mutually agree, which terms and conditions shall include those found necessary by the board of supervisors to ensure that the transfer will constitute an ongoing
				  material benefit to the county and its residents.(3)A transfer of the maintenance, operation, and management to the hospital authority shall not be construed as empowering the hospital authority to transfer any ownership interest of the county in the medical center except as otherwise approved by the board of supervisors.(o)The board of supervisors shall retain control over the use of the medical center physical plant and facilities except as otherwise specifically provided for in lawful agreements entered into by the board of supervisors. Any lease agreement or other agreement between the county and the hospital authority shall provide that county premises shall not be sublet without the approval of the board of supervisors.(p)The statutory authority of a board of supervisors to prescribe rules that authorize
				  a county hospital to integrate its services with those of other hospitals into a system of community service that offers free choice of hospitals to those requiring hospital care, as set forth in Section 14000.2 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, shall apply to the hospital authority upon a transfer of maintenance, operation, and management or ownership of the medical center by the county to the hospital authority.(q)The hospital authority shall have the power to acquire and possess real or personal property and may dispose of real or personal property other than that owned by the county, as may be necessary for the performance of its functions. The hospital authority shall have the power to sue or be sued, to employ personnel, and to contract for services required to meet its obligations.(r)Any agreement between the county and the hospital authority shall provide that all
				  existing services provided by the medical center shall continue to be provided to the county through the medical center subject to the policy of the county and consistent with the county’s obligations under Section 17000 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.(s)A hospital authority to which the maintenance, operation, and management or ownership of the medical center is transferred shall be a “district” within the meaning set forth in the County Employees Retirement Law of 1937 (Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 31450) of Part 3 of Division 4 of Title 3 of the Government Code). Employees of a hospital authority are eligible to participate in the County Employees Retirement System to the extent permitted by law.(t)Members of the governing board of the hospital authority shall not be vicariously liable for injuries caused by the act or omission of the hospital authority to the
				  extent that protection applies to members of governing boards of local public entities generally under Section 820.9 of the Government Code.(u)The hospital authority shall be a public agency subject to the Myers-Milias-Brown Act (Chapter 10 (commencing with Section 3500) of Division 4 of Title 1 of the Government Code).(v)Any transfer of functions from county employee classifications to a hospital authority established pursuant to this section shall result in the recognition by the hospital authority of the employee organization that represented the classifications performing those functions at the time of the transfer.(w)(1)In exercising its powers to employ personnel, as set forth in subdivision (p), the hospital authority shall implement, and the board of supervisors shall adopt, a
				  personnel transition plan.

				  authority of service with the county in determining the rate at which vacation accrues.(vii)The possible preservation of seniority, pensions, health benefits, and other applicable accrued benefits of employees of the county impacted by the transfer of governance.(2)Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed as prohibiting the hospital authority from determining the number of employees, the number of full-time equivalent positions, the job descriptions, and the nature and extent of classified employment positions.(3)Employees of the hospital authority are public employees for purposes of Division 3.6 (commencing with Section 810) of Title 1 of the Government Code relating to claims and actions against public entities and public employees.(x)Any hospital authority created pursuant to this section shall be bound by the terms of the memorandum of understanding executed by and between the county and health care and management employee organizations that is in effect as of the date this legislation becomes operative in the county.
