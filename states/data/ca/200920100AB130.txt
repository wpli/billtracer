						LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 130, Jeffries.
											  Vital records: marriage records.(1) Existing law prescribes specified personal information to be included on birth, death, and marriage certificates. Under existing law, a certified copy of a birth or death record may only be supplied by the State Registrar, local registrar, or county recorder to an authorized person, as defined, who submits a statement sworn under penalty of perjury that the applicant is an authorized person. If an applicant for a birth or death record does not meet the requirements for an authorized person, the State Registrar, local registrar, or county recorder may only issue an informational certified copy of a birth or death record that contains a legend stating “INFORMATIONAL, NOT A VALID DOCUMENT TO ESTABLISH IDENTITY.”Existing law also requires that each certified copy of a birth or death record contain specified information and be printed on sensitized paper with specified features.Existing law also requires an applicant for a certified copy of a birth or death record to pay, in addition to other fees applicable to the receipt of a copy of a birth or death record from the State Registrar, local registrar, or county recorder a fee of $1, to be used for the development of safety and security measures to protect against the fraudulent use of these records and defray the cost to local officials of any required security measures.This bill would also make these provisions applicable to a request for a certified copy of a nonconfidential marriage record, and would make conforming changes. By changing the definition of the crime of perjury, and by imposing new duties on local officials, this bill would create a state-mandated local program.(2) Existing law permits a county clerk to issue a confidential marriage license if prescribed conditions
		are met. Under existing law, a confidential marriage license is a confidential record and is not open to public inspection without an order from the court. Existing law requires a county clerk to maintain confidential marriage certificates as permanent records that are not open to public inspection except upon order of the court. Existing law permits a party to a confidential marriage to obtain a certified copy of the confidential marriage certificate, as prescribed.This bill would repeal the existing methods by which a party to a confidential marriage may obtain a certified copy of his or her confidential marriage certificate and would instead require that the above mentioned provisions relating to obtaining certified copies of birth and death records be applicable to a confidential marriage record, as specified. This bill would specify that an authorized person, for purposes of requests for certified copies of confidential marriage records, includes only a party
		to the confidential marriage. This bill would also prohibit the release of an informational certified copy of a confidential marriage record, as specified. By changing the definition of the crime of perjury, and by imposing new duties on local officials, this bill would create a state-mandated local program.(3) Existing law requires the State Registrar to appoint a Vital Records Protection Advisory Committee to study and make recommendations to protect individual privacy, inhibit identity theft, and prevent fraud involving birth and death certificates while providing needed access to the information contained in those records by persons seeking it for a legitimate purpose.This bill would add marriage records to the list of vital records under the committee’s consideration for study and recommendations, and would make other technical and conforming changes.(4) Existing law requires the State Registrar to maintain comprehensive indices of registered certificates. Under existing law, comprehensive birth and death record indices, as prescribed, must be kept confidential and are exempt from disclosure under the California Public Records Act. Existing law also requires the State Registrar to maintain separate noncomprehensive birth and death record indices for purposes of public release and for law enforcement and fraud prevention. Existing law also prohibits specified uses of birth and death record files. Violation of these provisions is a misdemeanor.This bill would apply these provisions to both comprehensive and noncomprehensive nonconfidential marriage indices. The bill would require that the noncomprehensive nonconfidential marriage record indices for public release and for law enforcement and fraud prevention be comprised of the name of each party to the
		marriage and the date of marriage. This bill would prohibit the noncomprehensive nonconfidential marriage record indices for public release from containing the maiden names of the parties’ mothers. By changing the definition of a crime, and by imposing new duties on local officials, this bill would create a state-mandated local program.(5) The California Constitution requires a statute that limits the people’s right of access to the meetings of public bodies and the writings of public officials and agencies to be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.This bill would declare that in order to protect personal privacy and reduce the risk of identity theft, it is necessary to enact provisions that generally restrict access to, and release of,
		marriage records.(6) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those
		costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.Digest Key

Local registrars and county recorders shall not issue informational certified copies of birth and death certificates from a source other than the statewide database prepared by the State Registrar. This subdivision shall become operative on July 1, 2007, but only after the statewide database becomes operational and the full calendar year of the birth and death indices and images is entered into the statewide database and is available for the respective year of the birth or death certificate for which an informational copy is requested.
				  The State Registrar shall provide written notification to local registrars and county recorders as soon as a year becomes available for issuance from the statewide database.SEC. 8. Section 103526.5 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:103526.5. (a) Each certified copy of a birth, death, or marriage record issued pursuant to Section 103525 shall include the date issued, the name of the issuing officer, the signature of the issuing officer, whether that is the State Registrar, local registrar, county recorder, or county clerk, or an authorized facsimile thereof, and the seal of the issuing office.(b) All certified copies of birth, death, and marriage records issued pursuant to Section 103525 shall be printed on chemically sensitized security paper that measures 81/2 inches by 11 inches and that has the following features:(A) Intaglio print.(B) Latent image.(C) Fluorescent, consecutive numbering with matching barcode.(D) Microprint line.(E) Prismatic printing.(F) Watermark.(G) Void pantograph.(H) Fluorescent security threads.(I) Fluorescent fibers.(J) Any other security features deemed necessary by the State Registrar.(c) The State Registrar, local registrars, county recorders, and county clerks shall take precautions to ensure that uniform and consistent standards are used statewide to safeguard the security paper described in subdivision (b), including, but not limited to, the following measures:(1) Security paper shall be maintained under secure conditions so as not to be accessible to the public.(2) A log shall be kept of all visitors allowed in the area where security paper is stored.(3) All spoilage shall be accounted for and subsequently destroyed by shredding on the premises.SEC. 9. Section 103527 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:103527. (a) The State Registrar shall appoint a Vital Records Protection Advisory Committee to study and make recommendations to protect individual privacy, inhibit identity theft, and prevent fraud involving birth, death, and marriage certificates while providing needed access to birth, death, and marriage record information to those seeking it for legitimate purposes. The committee shall have the following duties:(1) Review and make recommendations as to the adequacy of procedures to safeguard individual privacy and prevent fraud, while ensuring appropriate access to birth, death, and marriage records.(2) Make recommendations to the State Registrar as to items that

One-third of the initial committee membership shall be appointed to one-year terms, and one-third of the initial committee membership shall be appointed to two-year terms.SEC. 10. The Legislature finds and declares that Sections 2, 3, and 6 of this act impose a limitation on the public’s right of access to the writings of public officials within the meaning of Section 3 of Article 1 of the California Constitution. Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:In order to protect personal privacy and reduce the risk of identity theft when marriage records maintained by county recorders contain personal identifying information, including, but not limited to, an individual’s date of birth and mother’s maiden name, it is necessary to enact
		  legislation that generally restricts access to, and release of, marriage records.SEC. 11. No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution for certain costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district because, in that regard, this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.However, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains other costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.
