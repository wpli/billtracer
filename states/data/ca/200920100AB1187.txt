								CHAPTER
							 7. Delta Sustainability79730. (a) The Bay-Delta Estuary is a unique and irreplaceable combination of environmental and economic resources. Current management and use of the Delta is not sustainable, and results in a high level of conflict among various interests. Future Delta sustainability is threatened by changing hydrology due to climate change, water diversions, flood risk, seismic events, nonnative species, toxics, and other environmental problems. Future management of the Delta must improve Delta ecosystem health and improve the means of Delta water conveyance in order to protect drinking water quality, improve water supply reliability, restore ecosystem health, and preserve agricultural and recreational values in the Delta, while providing to counties and watersheds of origin assurances that their priority to water resources
						will be protected and that programs or facilities implemented or constructed in the Delta will not result in redirection of unmitigated, significant adverse impacts to the counties and watershed of origin. Many sources of funding will be needed to implement improved Delta management.(b) This chapter provides state funding for public benefits associated with projects needed to assist in the Delta’s sustainability as a vital resource for fish, wildlife, water quality, water supply, agriculture, and recreation.(c) In implementing this chapter, the Natural Resources Agency, or another agency as may be established by statute to provide oversight and management for Delta projects shall develop, in cooperation with the department, the Department of Fish and Game, and the State Water Resources Control Board, a comprehensive Delta sustainability plan that balances the coequal goals of
						ecosystem revitalization and environmentally sustainable water supply, consistent with criteria to be adopted by statute.79731. The sum of one billion nine hundred million dollars ($1,900,000,000) is available upon appropriation by the Legislature from the fund for grants and direct expenditure, as follows:(a) Seven hundred million dollars ($700,000,000) for projects that provide public benefits and support Delta sustainability options, including projects that do any of the following:(1) Ensure that urban and agricultural water supplies derived from the Delta, including water supplies used within the Delta, are not disrupted because of catastrophic failures of Delta levees resulting from earthquakes, floods, land sinking, rising ocean levels, or other forces.(2) Improve the quality of drinking water derived from the Delta.(3)  Provide physical improvements or other actions to create waterflow and water quality conditions within the Delta to provide adequate habitat for native fish and wildlife.(4) Facilitate other projects that provide public benefits and support Delta sustainability options approved by the Legislature, including costs associated with planning, monitoring, and design of alternatives, and project modifications and adaptations necessary to achieve the goals of this chapter.(b) One billion two hundred million dollars ($1,200,000,000) for projects to protect and enhance the sustainability of the Delta ecosystem, including any of the following:(1) Projects for the development
						and implementation of the Bay Delta Conservation Plan that promote the conservation, as that term is defined in Chapter 10 (commencing with Section 2800) of Division 3 of the Fish and Game Code, of covered species, and for native fishery restoration projects that are consistent with criteria to be adopted by statute. The projects shall be implemented through a cooperative effort among regulatory agencies, regulated and potentially regulated entities, and affected parties, including state and federal water contractors. These funds may be expended for the preparation of environmental documentation and environmental compliance that meets the requirements of Chapter 10 (commencing with Section 2800) of Division 3 of the Fish and Game Code.(2) Other projects to protect and restore native fish and wildlife dependent on the Delta ecosystem, including the acquisition of water rights, the removal or reduction of undesirable invasive species, and
						projects both in and out of the Delta that improve the ability to restore and recover native anadromous fish species.(3) Projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from exposed Delta soils.(4) Projects that reduce impacts of mercury contamination of the Delta and its watersheds, and remediation and elimination of continuing sources of mercury contamination.79732. The secretary, or other public official as may be designated by statute, shall submit the plan described in subdivision (c) of Section 79730 to the Legislature by June 30, 2011. By April 1 of each year following the submission of the plan, the secretary, or another public official as may be designated by statute, shall evaluate the progress in implementing the plan, determine if adequate progress is being made, and submit those findings to the Legislature along with recommendations to improve the implementation of the plan.79733. (a) Except as provided in subdivision (b), no funds may be appropriated for any project pursuant to this chapter unless the project is consistent with a comprehensive Delta sustainability plan adopted by statute.(b) Up to 10 percent of funds may be appropriated pursuant to this chapter prior to the adoption of the plan described in subdivision (a).
