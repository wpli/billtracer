						LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 134, Blakeslee.
											  Vehicles: off-highway motor vehicles.(1) Existing law requires the operator of an off-highway motor vehicle to be able to reach and operate all controls necessary to safely operate the vehicle.This bill would prohibit a parent or guardian of a child who is under 14 years of age, or an adult who is authorized by the parent or guardian to supervise that child, from granting permission to, or knowingly allowing, that child to operate an off-highway motor vehicle in a manner that violates the above-described requirement. By creating a new crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would require a court, upon a first conviction, to impose a fine of $35. The bill would also impose fines upon a 2nd or subsequent conviction.(2) Existing law requires the clerk of a court in which a person was convicted of a violation of the Vehicle Code to prepare
		within 5 days after conviction and immediately forward to the Department of Motor Vehicles an abstract of the record of the court covering the case in which the person was so convicted.This bill would expand the Vehicle Code violations that the clerk of a court is required to report to the department to include violations of special regulations with respect to operating a vehicle on public lands, local ordinances prohibiting entry into mountain fire districts, proper supervision requirements for a child under 14 years of age operating an off-highway vehicle, and proper supervision requirements for a child under 14 years of age operating an all-terrain vehicle.(3) Existing law establishes that specified convictions and violations under the Vehicle Code and traffic-related incidents count as points against a driver’s record for purposes of the suspension or revocation of the privilege to drive and that
		certain other violations do not result in a violation point count.This bill would expand the list of violations that do not result in a violation point count to include violations of special regulations with respect to operating a vehicle on public lands, local ordinances prohibiting entry into mountain fire districts, proper supervision requirements for a child under 14 years of age operating an off-highway vehicle, and proper supervision requirements for a child under 14 years of age operating an all-terrain vehicle. (4) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified
		reason.Digest Key
