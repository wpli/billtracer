						LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1541, Committee on Health.
										Health care coverage.Existing law, the federal Children’s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009, requires a group health plan to permit an eligible person to enroll for coverage under the plan if the person’s coverage under Medicaid or under a state child health plan was terminated, as specified, and the person applies for coverage under the group health plan not later than 60 days after that termination.Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care and makes a willful violation of the act a crime. Existing law also provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law authorizes plans and insurers to exclude late enrollees from group health care coverage for a specified period of time. Existing law defines a “late enrollee” as an eligible employee or
		dependent who has declined health coverage under a health benefit plan offered through employment or sponsored by an employer at the time of the initial enrollment period provided under the terms of the health benefit plan and who subsequently requests enrollment in that plan. Existing law provides that a late enrollee does not include an individual, or his or her dependent, who has lost or will lose Healthy Families Program coverage, as specified, or no share-of-cost Medi-Cal coverage and who requests enrollment within 30 days after termination of coverage or notification of the loss of coverage, as specified.This bill would define late enrollee to exclude an individual, or dependent, who has lost or will lose Healthy Families Program coverage, Access for Infants and Mothers Program coverage, or Medi-Cal
		program coverage and who requests enrollment within 60 days after termination of that coverage.Because a willful violation of the bill’s requirements with respect to health care service plans would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.Digest Key

                                YES  Bill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. It is the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation that would align state law with the provision of Section 311 of the federal Children’s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-3) that extends the period of time during which an employee or dependent may enroll in group health care coverage, if he or she is otherwise eligible, after termination of his or her coverage under Medicaid or another state child health plan.
		  SEC. 2. Section 1357 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:1357. As used in this article:(a) “Dependent” means the spouse or child of an eligible employee, subject to applicable terms of the health care plan contract covering the employee, and includes dependents of guaranteed association members if the association elects to include dependents under its health coverage at the same time it determines its membership composition pursuant to subdivision (o).(b) “Eligible employee” means either of the following:(1) Any permanent employee who is actively engaged on a full-time basis in the conduct of the business of the small employer with a normal workweek of at least 30 hours, at the
				  small employer’s regular places of business, who has met any statutorily authorized applicable waiting period requirements. The term includes sole proprietors or partners of a partnership, if they are actively engaged on a full-time basis in the small employer’s business and included as employees under a health care plan contract of a small employer, but does not include employees who work on a part-time, temporary, or substitute basis. It includes any eligible employee, as defined in this paragraph, who obtains coverage through a guaranteed association. Employees of employers purchasing through a guaranteed association shall be deemed to be eligible employees if they would otherwise meet the definition except for the number of persons employed by the employer. Permanent employees who work at least 20 hours but not more than 29 hours are deemed to be eligible employees if all four of the following apply:(A) They otherwise meet the definition
				  of an eligible employee except for the number of hours worked.(B) The employer offers the employees health coverage under a health benefit plan.(C) All similarly situated individuals are offered coverage under the health benefit plan.(D) The employee must have worked at least 20 hours per normal workweek for at least 50 percent of the weeks in the previous calendar quarter. The health care service plan may request any necessary information to document the hours and time period in question, including, but not limited to, payroll records and employee wage and tax filings.(2) Any member of a guaranteed association as defined in subdivision (o).(c) “In force business” means an existing
				  health benefit plan contract issued by the plan to a small employer.(d) “Late enrollee” means an eligible employee or dependent who has declined enrollment in a health benefit plan offered by a small employer at the time of the initial enrollment period provided under the terms of the health benefit plan and who subsequently requests enrollment in a health benefit plan of that small employer, provided that the initial enrollment period shall be a period of at least 30 days. It also means any member of an association that is a guaranteed association as well as any other person eligible to purchase through the guaranteed association when that person has failed to purchase coverage during the initial enrollment period provided under the terms of the guaranteed association’s plan contract and who subsequently requests enrollment in the plan, provided that the initial enrollment period shall be a period of at least 30 days. However, an eligible
				  employee, any other person eligible for coverage through a guaranteed association pursuant to subdivision (o), or an eligible dependent shall not be considered a late enrollee if any of the following is applicable:(1) The individual meets all of the following requirements:(A) He or she was covered under another employer health benefit plan, the Healthy Families Program, the Access for Infants and Mothers (AIM) Program, or the Medi-Cal program at the time the individual was eligible to enroll.(B) He or she certified at the time of the initial enrollment that coverage under another employer health benefit
				  plan, the Healthy Families Program, the AIM Program, or the Medi-Cal program was the reason for declining enrollment, provided that, if the individual was covered under another employer health plan, the individual was given the opportunity to make the certification required by this subdivision and was notified that failure to do so could result in later treatment as a late enrollee.(C) He or she has lost or will lose coverage under another employer health benefit plan as a result of termination of employment of the individual or of a person through whom the individual was covered as a dependent, change in employment status of the individual or of a person through whom the individual was covered as a dependent, termination of the
				  other plan’s coverage, cessation of an employer’s contribution toward an employee or dependent’s coverage, death of the person through whom the individual was covered as a dependent, legal separation, divorce, loss of coverage under the Healthy Families Program, the AIM Program, or the Medi-Cal program.(D) He or she requests enrollment within 30 days after termination of coverage or employer contribution toward coverage provided under another employer health benefit plan, or requests enrollment within 60 days after termination of Medi-Cal program coverage, AIM Program coverage, or Healthy Families Program coverage.(2) The employer offers multiple health benefit plans and the employee elects a different plan during an open enrollment period.(3) A court has ordered that coverage be provided for a spouse or minor child under a covered employee’s health benefit plan.(4) (A) In the case of an eligible employee, as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b), the plan cannot produce a written statement from the employer stating that the individual or the person through whom the individual was eligible to be covered as a dependent, prior to declining coverage, was provided with, and signed, acknowledgment of an explicit written notice in boldface type specifying that failure to elect coverage during the initial enrollment period permits the plan to impose, at the time of the individual’s later decision to elect coverage, an exclusion from coverage for a period of 12 months as well as a six-month preexisting condition exclusion, unless the individual meets the criteria specified in paragraph (1), (2), or (3).(B) In the case of an association member who did not purchase coverage through a guaranteed association, the plan cannot produce a written statement from the association stating that the association sent a written notice in boldface type to all potentially eligible association members at their last known address prior to the initial enrollment period informing members that failure to elect coverage during the initial enrollment period permits the plan to impose, at the time of the member’s later decision to elect coverage, an exclusion from coverage for a period of 12 months as well as a six-month preexisting condition exclusion unless the member can demonstrate that he or she meets the requirements of subparagraphs (A), (C), and (D) of paragraph (1) or meets the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3).(C) In the case of an employer or person who is not a member of an association, was
				  eligible to purchase coverage through a guaranteed association, and did not do so, and would not be eligible to purchase guaranteed coverage unless purchased through a guaranteed association, the employer or person can demonstrate that he or she meets the requirements of subparagraphs (A), (C), and (D) of paragraph (1), or meets the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3), or that he or she recently had a change in status that would make him or her eligible and that application for enrollment was made within 30 days of the change.(5) The individual is an employee or dependent who meets the criteria described in paragraph (1) and was under a COBRA continuation provision and the coverage under that provision has been exhausted.

				  enrolled eligible employee who has lost or will lose his or her coverage under the Healthy Families Program, the AIM Program, or the Medi-Cal program and requests enrollment within 60 days after termination of that coverage.(7) The individual is an eligible employee who previously declined coverage under an employer health benefit plan and who has subsequently acquired a dependent who would be eligible for coverage as a dependent of the employee through marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption, and who enrolls for coverage under that employer health benefit plan on his or her behalf and on behalf of his or her dependent within 30 days following the date of marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption, in which case the effective date of coverage shall
				  be the first day of the month following the date the completed request for enrollment is received in the case of marriage, or the date of birth, or the date of adoption or placement for adoption, whichever applies. Notice of the special enrollment rights contained in this paragraph shall be provided by the employer to an employee at or before the time the employee is offered an opportunity to enroll in plan coverage.(8) The individual is an eligible employee who has declined coverage for himself or herself or his or her dependents during a previous enrollment period because his or her dependents were covered by another employer health benefit plan at the time of the previous enrollment period. That individual may enroll himself or herself or his or her dependents for plan coverage during a special open enrollment opportunity if his or her dependents have lost or will lose coverage under that other employer health benefit plan. The special open
