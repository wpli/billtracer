Existing law authorizes the board to levy assessments on land in the drainage district to pay the principal and interest on the bonds. If the assessment is not paid by specified dates, the parcel of land that is the subject of the delinquency may be sold not less than 30 days nor more than 90 days from the date of the delinquency.This bill would extend from 30 to 45 days the time required before a delinquent sale can occur.
