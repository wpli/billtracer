						Alquist, Yee)February 27, 2009 An act to add and repeal Section 680.1 of the Penal Code, relating to sexual assault crimes. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1017, Portantino.
											  Sexual assault crimes.Existing law, the Sexual Assault Victims’ DNA Bill of Rights, authorizes a law enforcement agency investigating certain felony sex offenses, upon the request of the victim, and subject to the commitment of resources, to inform the victim whether or not a DNA profile was obtained from the testing of the rape kit evidence or other crime scene evidence from the case, whether or not that information has been entered into the Department of Justice Data Bank of case evidence, and whether or not there is a match between the DNA profile developed from the rape kit evidence or other crime scene evidence and a DNA profile contained in the Department of Justice Convicted Offender DNA Data Base, as specified. Existing law also requires that the victim be given written notification by the law enforcement agency if the law enforcement agency elects not to perform DNA testing of the rape kit evidence or other crime scene evidence, or intends to destroy or dispose of the rape
		kit evidence or other crime scene evidence prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations, as specified. Existing law provides that the sole civil or criminal remedy available to a sexual assault victim for a law enforcement agency’s failure to fulfill its responsibilities under the Sexual Assault Victims’ DNA Bill of Rights is standing to file a writ of mandamus to require compliance with these notification provisions.This bill would require local law enforcement agencies responsible for taking or processing rape kit evidence to annually report to the Department of Justice statistical information pertaining to the processing of rape kits,
		as specified. The reports received would be subject to inspection under the California Public Records Act. These provisions would become inoperative on July 1, 2015, and would be repealed on January 1, 2016.By imposing additional reporting duties on local law enforcement agencies, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.Digest Key
