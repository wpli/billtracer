											  Hate crimes.Existing law establishes the offense of a “hate crime” to mean a criminal act committed, in whole or in part, because of one or more actual or perceived characteristics, as specified, of the victim.This bill would add to the list of actual or perceived characteristics, political affiliation.By expanding the scope of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.Digest Key
