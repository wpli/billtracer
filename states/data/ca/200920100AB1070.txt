						LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1070, Hill.
											  Healing arts.(1) Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of osteopathic physicians and surgeons by the Osteopathic Medical Board of California, physicians and surgeons by the Medical Board of California (Medical Board), and podiatrists by the California Board of Podiatric Medicine. Existing law requires those licensees, insurers providing professional liability insurance to those licensees, and governmental agencies that self-insure those licensees to report specified settlements, arbitration awards, or civil judgments to the licensee’s board if based on the licensee’s alleged negligence, error, or omission in practice or his or her rendering of unauthorized professional services.This bill would specify that the reporting requirements apply to the University of California, as specified. With respect to a governmental agency required to submit a report, including a local governmental agency, the
		bill would require the agency to, prior to submitting a report, provide written notice of its intention to file a report to the affected licensee and provide the licensee with an opportunity to respond to the agency, as specified. By imposing new duties on local agencies, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.Existing law requires licensees and insurers required to make these reports to send a copy of the report to the claimant or his or her counsel and requires a claimant or his or her counsel who does not receive a copy of the report within a specified time period to make the report to the appropriate board. Existing law makes a failure of a licensee, claimant, or counsel to comply with these requirements a public offense punishable by a specified fine.This bill would require any entity or person required to make a report to notify the claimant or his or her counsel that the report has been sent to the
		appropriate board and would require the claimant or his or her counsel to make the report if the notice is not received within a specified time.The bill would also make a failure to substantially comply with any of the reporting requirements an infraction punishable by a specified fine. By expanding the scope of a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.Existing law requires these reports to include certain information, including a brief description of the facts of each claim, charge, or allegation, and the amount of the judgment or award and the date of its entry or service.This bill would eliminate the requirement that this description be brief and would require the description to also include the role of each physician and surgeon or podiatrist in the care or professional services provided to the patient, as specified. The bill would also require the
		report to include a copy of the judgment or award.(2) The Medical Practice Act provides for the regulation of physicians and surgeons by the Medical Board, and provides that the protection of the public is the highest priority for the board in exercising its licensing, regulatory, and disciplinary functions.This bill would prohibit any entity that provides early intervention, patient safety, or risk management programs to patients, or contracts for those programs for patients, from requiring that a patient waive his or her rights to contact or cooperate with the board, or to file a complaint with the board.(3) Existing law authorizes the Medical Board to appoint panels from its members for the purposes of fulfilling specified obligations and prohibits the president of the board from serving as a member of a panel.This bill would allow the president of the board to serve as a member of a panel if there is a vacancy in the membership of the board.(4) Under existing law, a physician and surgeon or podiatrist who fails to comply with a patient’s medical record request, as specified, within 15 days, or who fails or refuses to comply with a court order mandating release of records, is required to pay a civil penalty of $1,000 per day, as specified.This bill would place a limit of $10,000 on those civil penalties and would make other related changes, including providing a definition of “certified medical records,” as specified.(5) Existing law prescribes the disciplinary action that may be taken against a physician and surgeon or podiatrist. Among other things, existing law authorizes the licensee to be publicly
		reprimanded.This bill would authorize the public reprimand to include a requirement that the licensee complete educational courses approved by the board.(6) Existing law requires the Medical Board to request a licensed physician and surgeon to report, at the time of license renewal, any specialty board certification he or she holds, as specified. Existing law also authorizes a licensed physician and surgeon to report to the board, at the time of license renewal, information regarding his or her cultural background and foreign language proficiency.This bill would instead require licensees to provide that information at the time of license renewal and immediately upon issuance of an initial license, except as specified.Existing law requires a licensed physician and surgeon to also report, at the time of license
		renewal, his or her practice status, as specified.This bill would also require that this information be provided immediately upon issuance of an initial license.(7) Existing law creates the Health Quality Enforcement Section within the Department of Justice with the primary responsibility of investigating and prosecuting proceedings against licensees and applicants within the jurisdiction of the Medical Board and various other boards. Existing law simultaneously assigns a complaint received by the Medical Board to an investigator and a deputy attorney general, as specified. Existing law makes these provisions inoperative on July 1, 2010. Existing law also requires the Medical Board, in consultation with specified
		agencies, to report and make recommendations to the Governor and the Legislature on this prosecution model by July 1, 2009.This bill would extend the operation of those provisions until January 1, 2013. The bill would require the Medical Board to establish and implement a plan to assist in team building between its enforcement staff and the staff of the Health Quality Enforcement Section in order to ensure a common and consistent knowledge base.
		The bill would also require the Medical Board to, in consultation with specified agencies, report and make recommendations to the Governor and the Legislature on this enforcement and prosecution model by March 1, 2012. The bill would make other related changes.(8) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.With regard to any other mandates, this bill would
		provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.Digest Key

				  medical care foundation, an educational institution, a professional institution, a professional school or college, a general law corporation, a public entity, or a nonprofit organization that employs, retains, or contracts with a licensee referred to in this section.

				  under subdivision (b) shall notify the claimant or his or her counsel, if he or she is represented by counsel, that the report has been sent to the Medical Board of California, the Osteopathic Medical Board of California, or the California Board of Podiatric Medicine. If the claimant or his or her counsel has not received this notice within 45 days after the settlement was reduced to writing and signed by all of the parties or the arbitration award was served on the parties or the date of entry of the civil judgment, the claimant or the claimant’s counsel shall make the report to the appropriate board.(f) Failure to substantially comply with this section is a public offense punishable by a fine of not less than five hundred dollars ($500) and not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000).(g) (1) The Medical Board of California, the Osteopathic Medical Board

				  or his or her counsel that makes a report under this section and has received a copy of any written or electronic patient medical or hospital records prepared by the treating physician and surgeon or podiatrist, or the staff of the treating physician and surgeon, podiatrist, or hospital, describing the medical condition, history, care, or treatment of the person whose death or injury is the subject of the report, or a copy of any deposition in the matter that discusses the care, treatment, or medical condition of the person, shall include with the report, copies of the records and depositions, subject to reasonable costs to be paid by the Medical Board of California, the Osteopathic Medical Board of California, or the California Board of Podiatric Medicine. If confidentiality is required by court order and, as a result, the reporter is unable to provide the records and depositions, documentation to that effect shall accompany the original report. The applicable board may, upon prior notification of the
				  parties to the action, petition the appropriate court for modification of any protective order to permit disclosure to the board. A professional liability insurer, self-insured governmental agency, or licensee or his or her counsel shall maintain the records and depositions referred to in this paragraph for at least one year from the date of filing of the report required by this section.(h) If the board, within 60 days of its receipt of a report filed under this section, notifies a person named in the report, that person shall maintain for the period of three years from the date of filing of the report any records he or she has as to the matter in question and shall make those records available upon request to the board to which the report was sent.(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no insurer shall enter into a settlement without the written consent of the insured,
				  except that this prohibition shall not void any settlement entered into without that written consent. The requirement of written consent shall only be waived by both the insured and the insurer.(j) (1) A state or local governmental agency that self-insures licensees shall, prior to sending a report pursuant to this section, do all of the following with respect to each licensee who will be identified in the report:(A) Before deciding that a licensee will be identified, provide written notice to the licensee that the agency intends to submit a report in which the licensee may be identified, based on his or her role in the care or professional services provided to the patient that were at issue in the claim or action.

The Legislature recognizes that some entities even provide financial assistance to individual patients to help them address these unforeseen health care concerns. It is the intent of the Legislature, however, that such financial assistance not limit a patient’s interaction with, or his or her rights before, the Medical Board of California.Any entity that provides early intervention, patient safety, or risk management programs to patients, or contracts for those programs for patients, shall not include, as part of any
				  of those programs or contracts, any of the following:(a) A provision that prohibits a patient or patients from contacting or cooperating with the board.(b) A provision that prohibits a patient or patients from filing a complaint with the board.(c) A provision that requires a patient or patients to withdraw a complaint that has been filed with the board.SEC. 3. Section 2006 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read:2006. (a) Any reference in this chapter to an investigation by the board shall be deemed to refer to a joint investigation conducted by employees of the Department of Justice and the board under the vertical enforcement and prosecution model, as specified in Section 12529.6 of the Government Code.(b) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2013, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2013, deletes or extends that date.SEC. 4. Section 2008 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read:2008. The board may appoint panels from its members for the purpose of fulfilling the obligations established in subdivision (c) of Section 2004.

Because of the critical importance of the board’s public health and safety function, the complexity of cases involving alleged misconduct by physicians and surgeons, and the evidentiary burden in the board’s disciplinary cases, the Legislature finds and declares that using a vertical enforcement and prosecution model for those investigations is in the best interests of the people of California.(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, as of January 1, 2006, each complaint that is referred to a district office of the board for
