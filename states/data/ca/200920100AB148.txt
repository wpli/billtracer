                                NO  Bill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. The Legislature hereby finds and declares all of the following:(a) General agreement exists that the lack of clear organization and lines of authority in setting and executing education policy in California are significant and inexcusable reasons for the state’s inability to act efficiently in the best interests of the 6.25 million pupils in the state. The Governor, Legislature, State Board of Education, Superintendent of Public Instruction, Secretary for Education, and the State Department of Education each appear to develop their own priorities and agenda, often at the expense of, and in competition with, the others.(b) This measure seeks to
		  reorganize the policymaking and execution process into a more effective process with clear lines of authority.SEC. 2. Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 33700) is added to Part 20 of Division 2 of Title 2 of the Education Code, to read:

							 5. The California K-12 Education Policymaking Reorganization Act of 201033700. This chapter shall be known, and may be cited, as the California K-12 Policymaking Reorganization Act of 2010.33703. (a) The Superintendent of Public Instruction, using the resources of local educational agencies, county offices of education, and the State Department of Education shall provide to the Governor data in the form a report on the progress of education in kindergarten and grades 1 to 12, inclusive, on or before July 1 of each odd-numbered year. The data shall include all of the following:(1) Disaggregated pupil achievement data, including those pupils with special needs.(2) Teacher preparation and development data.(3) Standards and achievement of standards data.(4) Statewide assessment data.(5) Data demonstrating achievement of goals from previous plans.(6) Data on pupil

					 included in the report required by this section shall include data that has already been collected.

		  pupils, remain one of the least successful populations in our public schools.(d)Out of every 100 Latino pupils who enter grade 9, only seven enroll in four-year universities upon graduation.(e)Studies, including the 2007 Getting Down to Facts study, have identified effective leadership as a key to school improvement.(f)Former United States Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings has cited studies which estimate there will be a 30 percent turnover in principals over the next three years, and the Association of California Administrators
		  predicts there will be a 40 percent turnover in principals in California between 2008 and 2012.(g)The Multiple Pathways approach to high school reform identifies four essential components to school improvement:(1)A college-preparatory academic knowledge core for all.(2)A professional/technical knowledge core.(3)Demanding opportunities for authentic learning.(4)Support services to meet unique
		  pupil needs. SEC. 2.Section 44270.6 is added to the Education Code, to read:44270.6.(a)The Commission on Teacher Credentialing shall administer a one-year study that includes recent research and successful professional development practices to recommend more effective paths to transformational leadership through the administrative services credentialing process
				  for school principals and leaders.(b)The study shall define how the transformational leadership philosophies, knowledge, values, skills, and competencies can be added as part of the credentialing process for obtaining a preliminary or clear professional services credential with a specialization in administrative services and as an authorization added to an administrative services credential for those already
				  credentialed.(c)The goal of the study is to recommend to the commission and to the Legislature the most effective means by which California’s school principals and leaders can gain, demonstrate, and apply the educational philosophy, values, knowledge, skills, behaviors, and habits of mind to lead schools and educational communities in the process of transforming schools to:(1)Believe in the capacity of all pupils.(2)Commit to the success of all
				  pupils at high levels.(3)Prepare all pupils for college and other important educational steps beyond high school.(4)Individualize educational experiences for the unique needs of each pupil.(5)Engage in collaborative professional practices and collective learning.(6)Develop and support shared leadership practices.(d)The study shall
				  determine the following:(1)Whether the commission should recommend to credentialing programs to add an authorization in transformational leadership to administrative services credentials.(2)How to amend the existing credentialing for administrative services credentials to include demonstration that the standards
				  for transformational leadership have been met.(e)The study shall examine the standards for school leadership to determine whether they include the requisite standards for transformational leadership or should be revised to add standards or delete less critical standards.(f)The study shall examine and recommend the means by which
				  a person seeking to obtain an administrative services credential or transformational leadership authorization can demonstrate mastery of the standards necessary to serve as transformational leaders in schools.(g)The study may also include recommendations for leadership coaching, leadership induction, networking, and seminars, data tracking, and the relationship between preliminary and professional clear administrative services credentialing in terms of transformational leadership.(h)For purposes of this section, “transformational leadership”
				  means the body of knowledge and set of skills needed to transform an organization.(i)The commission shall conduct the study between July 1, 2010, and June 30, 2011, and shall report its findings to the Legislature no later than December 31, 2011.SEC. 3.This act shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2012, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2012, deletes or extends that date.
