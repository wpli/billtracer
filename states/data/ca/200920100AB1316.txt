						Furutani)February 27, 2009 An act to amend Sections 382 and 382.1 of the Public Utilities Code, relating to public utilities. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1316, as amended, Ma.
											  Public utilities: low-income customers.Existing law requires the Public Utilities Commission to establish a program of assistance to low-income electric and gas customers, which is referred to as the California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) program. Existing law establishes the Low-Income Oversight Board, composed of 11 members, for the purpose of advising the commission on low-income electric, gas, and water customer issues and serving as a liaison for the commission to low-income ratepayers and representatives. The board is required, to the extent possible, to monitor and evaluate all proceedings before the commission that impact low-income electricity, gas, and water customers. Existing law requires the commission, with the assistance of the board, to conduct periodically an assessment of the needs of low-income electricity and gas ratepayers. The board is authorized to establish a
		technical advisory committee and to request utility representatives and the staff of the commission to assist the technical advisory committee.This bill would require the board president of the commission to report biannually to the Legislature regarding appear annually before the appropriate policy committees of the Senate and Assembly to report on the status of low-income programs, and to the extent possible, the results of each assessment. The board would be required to review and make recommendations to the commission regarding the proposed budgets for programs provided to low-income
		electricity, gas, and water customers.
		The bill would delete that requirement that the board monitor and evaluate certain proceedings. The bill would delete the authority of the board to establish a technical advisory committee but would require the board to establish an advisory committee to assist the board. The bill would also expand the membership of the board to include a member selected by the State Air Resources Board.Digest Key
