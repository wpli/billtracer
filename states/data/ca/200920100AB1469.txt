											  Workers’ compensation.Existing law establishes a workers’ compensation system to compensate an employee for injuries sustained in the course of employment. Under this system, the Workers’ Compensation Appeals Board has jurisdiction to determine these claims. Existing law prohibits petitions filed with the appeals board concerning a continuing temporary disability award from being granted while the injured worker is pursuing a rehabilitation plan.This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to this provision.Digest Key
