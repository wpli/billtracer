											  Commercial motor vehicles: unsafe vehicles. Goods Movement Emission Reduction Program.Existing law, the Highway Safety, Traffic Reduction, Air Quality, and Port Security Bond Act of 2006, approved by the voters as Proposition 1B at the November 7, 2006, general election, authorizes the issuance of general obligation bonds for various transportation-related purposes, including reducing emissions and improving air quality in trade corridors. The State Air Resources Board is required to allocate the funds to be used for air quality purposes pursuant to specified requirements.This bill would require that priority be given to projects that secure other supplemental funding in an amount that is above a percentage requirement required by existing law, as provided.Existing law authorizes any member of the Department of the California Highway Patrol to remove from the highway and have placed in a storage facility specified commercial motor vehicles and any motortruck with a gross vehicle weight rating of more than 10,000 pounds, which are in an unsafe condition, or impound a farm labor vehicle operated in violation of specified provisions of law.This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to these provisions.Digest Key

				  ocean freight carriers calling at the state’s seaports to reduce the use of auxiliary and main engine ship power.(E) Mobile or portable shoreside distributed power generation projects that eliminate the need to use the electricity grid.(F) The replacement, repower, or retrofit of cargo handling equipment that operates at the state’s seaports and rail yards.(G) Electrification infrastructure to reduce engine idling and use of internal combustion auxiliary power systems at truck stops, intermodal facilities, distribution centers, and other places where trucks congregate.(b) (1) The state board shall allocate funds in a manner that gives priority to emission reduction projects that achieve the earliest possible reduction of health risk in communities with the highest health risks from goods movement facilities.
				  Priority shall also be given to projects that secure other supplemental funding in an amount that is above the specified percentage requirement determined pursuant to subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 39626, in these high risk communities, as determined by the state board.(2) In evaluating which projects to fund, the state board shall at a minimum consider all of the following criteria:(A) The magnitude of the emission reduction.(B) The public health benefits of the emission reduction.(C) The cost-effectiveness and sustainability of the emissions reductions.(D) The severity and magnitude of the emission source’s contributions to emissions.(E) Regulatory and State Implementation Plan requirements, and the degree of surplus emissions to be reduced.(F) The
				  reduction in greenhouse gases, consistent with and supportive of emission reduction goals, consistent with existing law.(G) The extent to which advanced emission reduction technologies are to be used.(H) The degree to which funds are leveraged from other sources.(I) The degree to which the project reduces air pollutants or air contaminants in furtherance of achieving state and federal ambient air quality standards and reducing toxic air contaminants.(J) The total emission reductions a project would achieve over its lifetime per state dollar invested.(K) Whether an emissions reduction is likely to occur in a location where emissions sources in the area expose individuals and population groups to elevated emissions that result in adverse health effects and contribute to cumulative human exposures to pollution.(c) The state board shall
				  ensure that state bond funds are supplemented and matched with funds from federal, local, and private sources to the maximum extent feasible.SECTION 1.Section 34506.4 of the Vehicle Code is amended to read:34506.4.(a)A member of the Department of the California Highway Patrol may remove from the highway and have placed in a storage facility, a vehicle described in subdivision (a) of Section 22406 or subdivision (g) of
