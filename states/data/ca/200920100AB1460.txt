										Economic development. State government: international relations.Existing law authorizes any public corporation, as defined, and specified private corporations to apply for the privilege of establishing, operating, and maintaining a foreign trade zone in accordance with federal law, and provides that any public or private corporation whose application is granted pursuant to federal law is authorized to establish, operate, and maintain a foreign trade zone, subject to specified conditions.Existing law establishes the Office of California-Mexico Affairs to serve as a clearinghouse for information and assistance to other state agencies involved with Mexico, and to develop favorable relations with Mexico.Existing law establishes the California-Mexico Border Relations Council to consist of specified state officials. The duties of the council include, among other things,
		coordinating activities of state agencies that are related to cross-border programs, initiatives, projects, and partnerships that exist within state government. The council is required to annually submit a report on its activities to the Legislature.This bill would recodify and reorganize the above provisions.(1) Existing law requires the Secretary of Labor and Workforce Development to convene a biennial economic strategy panel, known as the California Economic Strategy Panel and consisting of specified appointed members, for purposes of providing recommendations regarding a California Economic Development Strategic Plan and to review those recommendations made by the panel in its biennial economic development strategic plan document, as specified. Existing law requires the panel to address various specified matters of concern, including the development of a system of accountability for use in the annual state budget process and in the legislative process to measure the performance of all state policies, programs, and tax expenditures intended to stimulate the economy. Existing law also requires the panel to submit a report of its findings and recommendations to the Legislature no later than one year after its first meeting
		after January 1, 2005.This bill would, instead, require the California Economic Strategy Panel to prepare and submit a preliminary version of the California Economic Development Strategic Plan to the Governor and the Legislature prior to January 1, 2011, and to prepare a final version of the plan within 5 months of the conclusion of required hearings by the Legislature on the preliminary version of the plan. The bill would require the development of the plan to be funded from private donations. The bill would require the Secretary of Labor and Workforce Development to collaborate with the Secretaries of Business, Transportation and Housing and Food and Agriculture in leading the preparation of the California Economic Development Strategic Plan and would require the panel to assess specified matters in preparing the plan, to consult with other state entities, and to review and include certain materials appropriate to completion of the plan. The bill would require that
		particular components be included in the plan and would delete a system of accountability for use in the state budget process from required elements for the panel’s consideration. The bill would require the panel to review the plan 5 years after its finalization and every 5 years thereafter and to update the plan as the panel determines necessary. The bill would modify the composition of the California Economic Strategy Panel by adding the Secretary of Business, Transportation and Housing, the Secretary of Food and Agriculture, the Director of the Office of Small Business Advocate, and the Executive Director of the California Council on Science and Technology, as members of the panel and would, beginning October 1, 2011, require the panel to report biennially to the Legislature on its activities.(2) Existing law creates the California Economic Development Fund, and provides for the deposit of government and private economic development funds into it. Under existing law, these funds, upon appropriation by the Legislature, may be expended by the Secretary of Business, Transportation and Housing for economic development purposes.This bill would authorize the Secretary of Business, Transportation and Housing to accept monetary gifts, which would be deposited in the California Economic Development Fund, for the cost of developing and updating economic and workforce development studies, strategies, and policies. The bill would require the secretary to record each gift and to file a copy of the record with the Business, Transportation and Housing Agency.Digest Key

The state’s significance in the global marketplace results from a variety of factors, including the following:(1)Its strategic west coast location that provides direct access to the growing markets and technology centers in Asia, Mexico, and Latin America.(2)Its diverse regional economies.(3)Its large, young, and ethnically diverse
		  population that provides a ready workforce, a source of cultural intelligence for pursuing international business, and a significant consumer base.(4)Its access to a wide variety of venture and other private capital.(5)Its large number and broad base of small- and medium-sized businesses.(6)Its rich inventory of skilled participants in an innovation economy, including not only technologists and scientists, but also designers and entrepreneurs.(7)Its history of pioneering innovation business models, with the Hollywood entertainment industry, electronic commerce, venture capital businesses, and the Lockheed skunk works representing some well-known examples of this innovation.(8)Its
		  culture of innovation and entrepreneurship, particularly in the area of high technology.(b)In general, California is well-positioned to take advantage of the new technologies and innovations. However, other states and foreign countries are also vying for direct investment and for leadership in current and emerging technology industries as well as the sciences supporting and relating to those industries. Connecticut, Massachusetts, Texas, New Mexico, New York, New Jersey, Florida, and Pennsylvania all have proactive economic competitiveness policies. Countries in Europe and Asia, such as Finland and Singapore, are also successfully pursuing national innovation strategies. Germany and Japan have already surpassed California’s once leading position in solar and wind energy through targeted policies and initiatives.(c)The bases for competition in an increasingly globalized
		  innovation economy are shifting. California can no longer compete based on being the low-cost player. The increasing desirability of countries, such as China, to companies seeking to outsource manufacturing services and research and development is well known. Dozens of countries around the world are pursuing national innovation agendas at flank speed as the perception grows of a global value chain with many different players and phases: scientific discovery, research and development, business development, management and logistics innovation, energy efficiency, increases in productivity, and commercialization. These countries are working to carve out new positions in this global value chain. Given this global context, California must reexamine and reframe its role within the emerging global innovation economy and develop skills of systems integration and collaboration in a world in which competition is less about “I win, you lose” dynamics and more about “co-opetition,” with the value chain spreading out
		  around the world to serve regional and local markets.(d)California could lose its pivotal global role in the design and manufacture of technologies by not implementing its own proactive, aggressive, and comprehensive strategy for supporting California’s technology-based industries, including, but not limited to, computers, commercial space, biotech, digital media, Web 2.0, cleantech, energy generation, and nanotech.(e)Supporting the state’s technology economy will require the state to increase its investment in the human and physical infrastructure necessary to support this type of innovation. This investment cannot simply fund “more of the same.” Rather, the state needs new kinds of fundable strategies that will lead it into new streams of opportunities.(f)California’s innovation and technology policies should
		  be regularly updated to reflect emerging scientific developments, business and financing trends, and the changing needs of California’s businesses and workers. It should seek to capitalize on best practices in strategic and technology foresight and related time dynamics that tie critical trends and actions together in order to capture a sense of the emerging agendas and emerging large-scale challenges that galvanize resources and the public’s imagination.(g)California’s innovation and technology policies must pay attention to the methods used by educational institutions to provide critical advantages that leverage workforce training innovations in this new global economy. The California institutes provide an example of research innovation in this area. Other countries are now innovating in their education enterprise, and a recent example of this process is Finland’s announcement of an “Innovation University.”(h)To be successful, the state’s innovation and technology policies must reflect a stewardship function that addresses fundamental questions such as who will be responsible; what authorities and resources will be provided to do the work; what provisions will be made to assure sustainability of the effort; and how will the state know that it is making the right decisions to support future business competitive advantages?SEC. 3.Section 13997.5 is added to the Government Code, to read:13997.5.(a)The Secretary of Business, Transportation and Housing may accept monetary gifts to pay for a part of, or the entire cost of, developing and updating the California Economic Development Strategic Plan pursuant to Section 15570. Any moneys received as a gift pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the California Economic Development Fund, established pursuant to Section 13997.6. Records of donations received and expenditures made pursuant to this section shall be subject to public disclosure.(b)The secretary shall record each gift received pursuant to this section, including all of the following information for each gift:(1)The donor’s name and the amount of the
				  donation.(2)A description of the manner in which the donation was expended.(c)The secretary shall, within 30 days of receipt of the donation, provide a copy of the record to the Business, Transportation and Housing Agency, and the agency shall maintain the record with its statements of economic interests.SEC. 4.Section 15570 of the Government Code is repealed.SEC. 5.Section 15570 is added to the Government Code, to read:15570.(a)The California Economic Strategy Panel within the office of the Secretary of Labor and Workforce Development shall research, facilitate outreach, and make policy and fiscal recommendations to the Governor and the Legislature on issues related to economic and workforce development.(b)(1)The panel shall be composed of the following 19 members:(A)The Secretary of Labor and Workforce Development, who shall serve as the chairperson of the panel.(B)The Secretary of Business, Transportation and Housing.(C)The Secretary of Food and Agriculture.(D)Eight persons appointed by the Governor, at least one of whom shall have a background in economic development.(E)The Speaker of the Assembly or his or her designee.(F)The President pro Tempore of the Senate or his or her designee.(G)The Minority Leader of the Assembly or his or her designee.(H)The Minority Leader of the Senate or his or her designee.(I)One person appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly.(J)One person appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules.(K)The Director of the Office of Small Business Advocate.(L)The Executive Director of the California Council on Science and Technology.(2)Members of the panel shall be representatives of state government, business, economic developers, labor, finance, and academic institutions, and shall be broadly reflective of the state’s population as to gender, ethnicity, and geographic residence within California.(3)At least one-half of all the persons on the panel shall be from the private sector, and at least two appointments shall be from private businesses with less than 50 employees.
