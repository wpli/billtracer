											  State budget.The California Constitution requires the Governor to submit annually to the Legislature a budget itemizing state expenditures and estimating state revenues and requires the Legislature to pass the Budget Bill by midnight on June 15. Under existing law, a state agency for which an appropriation is made is generally required to submit to the Department of Finance for approval a complete and detailed budget setting forth all proposed expenditures and estimated revenues for the ensuing fiscal year.This bill would require that the budget submitted by the Governor to the Legislature for the 2011–12 fiscal year and each following year be developed pursuant to performance-based budgeting methods, as defined, for each state agency. The bill would also require the Department of Finance to utilize the annual report on the measurements of performance-based budgeting methods prepared by the Joint Legislative Budget Committee.The bill would establish a task force comprised of the Director of Finance, the Controller, and the Chairperson of the Joint Legislative Budget Committee to develop performance-based budgeting guidelines and procedures and to develop a training and education program for state agency personnel involved in the budget process.Digest Key
