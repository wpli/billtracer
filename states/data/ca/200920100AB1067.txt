LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1067, as amended, Brownley.
											  Children in foster care: school proximity and travel costs.(1) Under existing law, the governing board of a school district may provide transportation to and from schools under specified circumstances. The governing board may, in In some circumstances, the governing board may require the parents and guardians of all or some of the pupils transported to pay a portion of the costs.This bill would require governing boards that provide transportation to take into account the transportation needs of foster youth, as specified.Under existing law, the state provides for specified funding for school districts, including
		funding for home-to-school transportation. This bill would include transportation of foster youth to their school of origin in the definition of home-to-school transportation for these funding purposes.Existing law specifies a process to be conducted by the local educational agency and the county placing agency to determine the placement of a foster child in school, including determining the school of origin, methods for transfer, if appropriate, procedures for students who miss school for specified reasons, and the payment of transportation costs. The local educational agency and the county placing agency are encouraged to collaborate in this process. This bill would make specified changes to the overall process and would specify that, as part of the collaborative efforts, a memorandum of understanding or equivalent mutual agreement be entered into to support a collaborative
		process for providing transportation for foster youth to their school of origin, as specified.  Existing law requires that a local educational agency ensure that no lowering of grades occur under prescribed circumstances, including when a pupil in foster care is absent due to a decision made by a court or placing agency to change the placement of the pupil or to a verified court appearance or other court activity.This bill would add to these circumstances an absence of a child in foster care caused by a delay in securing appropriate transportation to the child’s school of origin.By imposing new duties upon local educational agencies, the bill would constitute a state-mandated local program.(2) Existing law declares the intent of the Legislature to preserve and strengthen a child’s family ties whenever possible,
		removing the child from the custody of his or her parents only when necessary for his or her welfare or for the safety and protection of the public. Existing law includes various provisions relating to the provision of appropriate placement and other services for children in foster care. When placement is determined for a child who has been adjudged a dependent of the juvenile court, existing law requires a social study to be made by a social worker or child advocate appointed by the court. Existing law requires the child’s case plan to include a health and education summary, which, among other components, is required to include assurances that the placement takes into account proximity to the school in which the child is enrolled at the time of placement.This bill would require the social study of a dependent child of the juvenile court to address whether the proposed placement takes school proximity into account and whether a transportation plan has been
		developed to ensure that the child remains enrolled in his or her school of origin, unless inappropriate, if the child’s proposed placement is not in proximity to that school.The bill would require that the health and education summary also include assurances that the child welfare agency has taken specified steps to ensure that the child remains in the school in which he or she is enrolled at the time of placement. It would further require that the child’s case plan include an emergency
		transportation plan that identifies resources and funding that shall be used, when necessary, to transport the child to the school of origin, if the child must be moved. The bill would also state that county placing agencies are ultimately responsible for ensuring that the foster youth remain in his or her school of origin, unless inappropriate, and for providing transportation.By imposing additional duties upon child welfare agencies, the bill would create a state-mandated local program. This bill also would require the State Department of Social Services to take all necessary actions to maximize eligibility for available federal funding for reasonable travel costs for children in foster care, in accordance with a specified provision of federal law.Under existing
		law, foster care providers are paid a specified rate for care and supervision of foster youth.This bill would include reasonable travel costs for the child to remain in his or her school of origin in those costs. (3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.Digest Key

The plan shall set forth procedures describing how each county will perform the following services:(A) Identify, locate, and continue availability of services for children under state care or
				  supervision who are displaced or adversely affected by a disaster.(B) Respond, as appropriate, to new child welfare cases in areas adversely affected by a disaster, and provide services in those cases.(C) Remain in communication with caseworkers and other essential child welfare personnel who are displaced because of a disaster.(D) Preserve essential program records.(E) Coordinate services and share information with other counties.(2) The department shall review its disaster plan with respect to subparagraphs (A) to (E), inclusive, of paragraph (1), and shall revise the plan to clarify the role and responsibilities of the state in the event of a disaster.(3) The department shall consult with counties to identify opportunities for collaboration between counties, and between the county and the state, in the event of a disaster.(d) In carrying out the requirements of subdivisions (b) and (c), the department shall do all of the following:(1) Consider the existing array of program models provided in statute and in practice, including, but not limited to, wraparound services, as defined in Section 18251, children’s systems of care, as provided for in Section 5852, the Oregon Family Unity or Santa Clara County Family Conference models, which include family conferences at key points in the casework process, such as when out-of-home placement or return home is considered, and the Annie E. Casey Foundation Family to Family initiative, which uses team decisionmaking in case
				  planning, community-based placement practices requiring that children be placed in foster care in the communities where they resided prior to placement, and involve foster families as team members in family reunification efforts.(2) Ensure that emergency response services, family maintenance services, family reunification services, and permanent placement services are coordinated with the implementation of the models described in paragraph (1).(3) Ensure consistency between child welfare services program regulations and the program models described in paragraph (1).(e) The department, in conjunction with stakeholders, including, but not limited to, county child welfare services agencies, foster parent and group home associations, the California Youth Connection, and other child advocacy groups, shall review the
				  existing child welfare services program regulations to ensure that these regulations are consistent with the legislative intent specified in subdivision (a). This review shall also determine how to incorporate the best practice guidelines for assessment of children and families receiving child welfare and foster care services, as required by Section 16501.2.(f) The department shall report to the Legislature on the results of the actions taken under this section on or before January 1, 2002.SEC. 10.Section 16501.1 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:16501.1.(a)(1)The Legislature finds and declares that the foundation and central unifying tool in child welfare services is the case plan.(2)The Legislature further finds and declares that a case plan ensures that the child receives protection and safe and proper care and case management, and that services are provided to the child and parents or other caretakers, as appropriate, in order to improve conditions in the parent’s home, to facilitate the safe return of the child to a safe home or the permanent placement of the child, and to address the needs of the child while in foster care.(b)(1)A case plan shall be based upon the principles of this section and shall document that a preplacement assessment of the service needs of
				  the child and family, and preplacement preventive services, have been provided, and that reasonable efforts to prevent out-of-home placement have been made.(2)In determining the reasonable services to be offered or provided, the child’s health and safety shall be the paramount concerns.(3)Reasonable services shall be offered or provided to make it possible for a child to return to a safe home environment, unless, pursuant to subdivisions (b) and (e) of Section 361.5, the court determines that reunification services shall not be provided.(4)If reasonable services are not ordered, or are terminated, reasonable efforts shall be made to place the child in a timely manner in accordance with the permanent plan and to complete all steps necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the child.(c)(1)If out-of-home placement is used to attain case plan goals, the decision
				  regarding choice of placement shall be based upon selection of a safe setting that is the least restrictive or most familylike and the most appropriate setting that is available and in close proximity to the parent’s home, proximity to the child’s school, consistent with the selection of the environment best suited to meet the child’s special needs and best interests, or both. The selection shall consider, in order of priority, placement with relatives, tribal members, and foster family, group care, and residential treatment pursuant to Section 7950 of the Family Code.(2)In addition to the requirements of paragraph (1), and taking into account other statutory considerations regarding placement, the selection of the most appropriate home that will meet the child’s special needs and best interests shall also promote educational stability by taking into consideration proximity to the child’s school attendance area
				  and shall include an emergency transportation plan that identifies resources and funding that shall be used, when necessary, to transport the child to the school of origin if the child must be moved.(d)A written case plan shall be completed within a maximum of 60 days of the initial removal of the child or of the in-person response required under subdivision (f) of Section 16501 if the child has not been removed from his or her home, or by the date of the dispositional hearing pursuant to Section 358, whichever occurs first. The case plan shall be updated, as the service needs of the child and family dictate. At a minimum, the case plan shall be updated in conjunction with each status review hearing conducted pursuant to Section 366.21, and the hearing conducted pursuant to Section 366.26, but no less frequently than once every six months. Each updated case plan shall include a description of the services that have been provided to the
				  child under the plan and an evaluation of the appropriateness and effectiveness of those services.(1)It is the intent of the Legislature that extending the maximum time available for preparing a written case plan from 30 to 60 days will afford caseworkers time to actively engage families, and to solicit and integrate into the case plan the input of the child and the child’s family, as well as the input of relatives and other interested parties.(2)The extension of the maximum time available for preparing a written case plan from the 30 to 60 days shall be effective 90 days after the date that the department gives counties written notice that necessary changes have been made to the Child Welfare Services Case Management System to account for the 60-day timeframe for preparing a written case plan.(e)The child welfare services case plan shall be comprehensive enough to meet the juvenile court dependency proceedings
				  requirements pursuant to Article 6 (commencing with Section 300) of Chapter 2 of Part 1 of Division 2.(f)The case plan shall be developed as follows:(1)The case plan shall be based upon an assessment of the circumstances that required child welfare services intervention. The child shall be involved in developing the case plan as age and developmentally appropriate.(2)The case plan shall identify specific goals and the appropriateness of the planned services in meeting those goals.(3)The case plan shall identify the original allegations of abuse or neglect, as defined in Article 2.5 (commencing with Section 11164) of Chapter 2 of Title 1 of Part 4 of the Penal Code, or the conditions cited as the basis for declaring the child a dependent of the court pursuant to Section 300, or all of these, and the other precipitating incidents that led to child welfare services intervention.(4)The case plan shall include a description of the schedule of the social worker contacts with the child and the family or other caretakers. The frequency of these contacts shall be in accordance with regulations adopted by the State Department of Social Services. If the child has been placed in foster care out of state, the county social worker or a social worker on the staff of the social services agency in the state in which the child has been placed shall visit the child in a foster family home or the home of a relative, consistent with federal law and in accordance with the department’s approved state plan. For children in out-of-state group home facilities, visits shall be conducted at least monthly, pursuant to Section 16516.5. At least once every six months, at the time of a regularly scheduled social worker contact with the foster child, the child’s social worker shall inform the child of his or her rights as a foster child, as specified in Section 16001.9. The social worker shall
				  provide the information to the child in a manner appropriate to the age or developmental level of the child.(5)(A)When out-of-home services are used, the frequency of contact between the natural parents or legal guardians and the child shall be specified in the case plan. The frequency of those contacts shall reflect overall case goals, and consider other principles outlined in this section.(B)Information regarding any court-ordered visitation between the child and the natural parents or legal guardians, and the terms and conditions needed to facilitate the visits while protecting the safety of the child, shall be provided to the child’s out-of-home caregiver as soon as possible after the court order is made.(6)When out-of-home placement is made, the case plan shall include provisions for the development and maintenance of sibling relationships as specified in subdivisions (b), (c), and (d) of
				  Section 16002. If appropriate, when siblings who are dependents of the juvenile court are not placed together, the social worker for each child, if different, shall communicate with each of the other social workers and ensure that the child’s siblings are informed of significant life events that occur within their extended family. Unless it has been determined that it is inappropriate in a particular case to keep siblings informed of significant life events that occur within the extended family, the social worker shall determine the appropriate means and setting for disclosure of this information to the child commensurate with the child’s age and emotional well-being. These significant life events shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:(A)The death of an immediate relative.(B)The birth of a sibling.(C)Significant changes regarding a dependent child, unless the child objects to the sharing of the
				  information with his or her siblings, including changes in placement, major medical or mental health diagnoses, treatments, or hospitalizations, arrests, and changes in the permanent plan.(7)If out-of-home placement is made in a foster family home, group home, or other child care institution that is either a substantial distance from the home of the child’s parent or out of state, the case plan shall specify the reasons why that placement is in the best interest of the child. When an out-of-state group home placement is recommended or made, the case plan shall, in addition, specify compliance with Section 7911.1 of the Family Code.(8)(A)If out-of-home services are used, or if parental rights have been terminated and the case plan is placement for adoption, the case plan shall include a recommendation regarding the appropriateness of unsupervised visitation between the child and any of the child’s siblings. This recommendation
				  shall include a statement regarding the child’s and the siblings’ willingness to participate in unsupervised visitation. If the case plan includes a recommendation for unsupervised sibling visitation, the plan shall also note that information necessary to accomplish this visitation has been provided to the child or to the child’s siblings.(B)Information regarding the schedule and frequency of the visits between the child and siblings, as well as any court-ordered terms and conditions needed to facilitate the visits while protecting the safety of the child, shall be provided to the child’s out-of-home caregiver as soon as possible after the court order is made.(9)If out-of-home services are used and the goal is reunification, the case plan shall describe the services to be provided to assist in reunification and the services to be provided concurrently to achieve legal permanency if efforts to reunify fail. The plan shall also consider in-state and
				  out-of-state placements, the importance of developing and maintaining sibling relationships pursuant to Section 16002, and the desire and willingness of the caregiver to provide legal permanency for the child if reunification is unsuccessful.(10)If out-of-home services are used, the child has been in care for at least 12 months, and the goal is not adoptive placement, the case plan shall include documentation of the compelling reason or reasons why termination of parental rights is not in the child’s best interest. A determination completed or updated within the past 12 months by the department when it is acting as an adoption agency or by a licensed adoption agency that it is unlikely that the child will be adopted, or that one of the conditions described in paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) of Section 366.26 applies, shall be deemed a compelling reason.(11)(A)Parents and legal guardians shall have an opportunity to review the
				  case plan, and to sign it whenever possible, and then shall receive a copy of the plan. In any voluntary service or placement agreement, the parents or legal guardians shall be required to review and sign the case plan. Whenever possible, parents and legal guardians shall participate in the development of the case plan.(B)Parents and legal guardians shall be advised that, pursuant to Section 1228.1 of the Evidence Code, neither their signature on the child welfare services case plan nor their acceptance of any services prescribed in the child welfare services case plan shall constitute an admission of guilt or be used as evidence against the parent or legal guardian in a court of law. However, they shall also be advised that the parent’s or guardian’s failure to cooperate, except for good cause, in the provision of services specified in the child welfare services case plan may be used in any hearing held pursuant to Section 366.21 or 366.22 as evidence.(12)A child shall be given a meaningful opportunity to participate in the development of the case plan and state his or her preference for foster care placement. A child who is 12 years of age or older and in a permanent placement shall also be given the opportunity to review the case plan, sign the case plan, and receive a copy of the case plan.(13)The case plan shall be included in the court report and shall be considered by the court at the initial hearing and each review hearing. Modifications to the case plan made during the period between review hearings need not be approved by the court if the casework supervisor for that case determines that the modifications further the goals of the plan. If out-of-home services are used with the goal of family reunification, the case plan shall consider and describe the application of subdivision (b) of Section 11203.(14)If the case plan has as its goal for the child a permanent plan of
				  adoption or placement in another permanent home, it shall include a statement of the child’s wishes regarding their permanent placement plan and an assessment of those stated wishes. The agency shall also include documentation of the steps the agency is taking to find an adoptive family or other permanent living arrangements for the child; to place the child with an adoptive family, an appropriate and willing relative, a legal guardian, or in another planned permanent living arrangement; and to finalize the adoption or legal guardianship. At a minimum, the documentation shall include child-specific recruitment efforts, such as the use of state, regional, and national adoption exchanges, including electronic exchange systems, when the child has been freed for adoption.(15)When appropriate, for a child who is 16 years of age or older, the case plan shall include a written description of the programs and services that will help the child, consistent with the child’s best interests,
				  prepare for the transition from foster care to independent living. The case plan shall be developed with the child and individuals identified as important to the child, and shall include steps the agency is taking to ensure that the child has a connection to a caring adult.(g)If the court finds, after considering the case plan, that unsupervised sibling visitation is appropriate and has been consented to, the court shall order that the child or the child’s siblings, the child’s current caregiver, and the child’s prospective adoptive parents, if applicable, be provided with information necessary to accomplish this visitation. This section does not require or prohibit the social worker’s facilitation, transportation, or supervision of visits between the child and his or her siblings.(h)The case plan documentation on sibling placements required under this section shall not require modification of existing case plan forms until the Child Welfare
				  Services Case Management System is implemented on a statewide basis.(i)When a child who is 10 years of age or older and who has been in out-of-home placement for six months or longer, the case plan shall include an identification of individuals, other than the child’s siblings, who are important to the child and actions necessary to maintain the child’s relationship with those individuals, provided that those relationships are in the best interest of the child. The social worker shall ask every child who is 10 years of age or older and who has been in out-of-home placement for six months or longer to identify individuals other than the child’s siblings who are important to the child, and may ask any other child to provide that information, as appropriate. The social worker shall make efforts to identify other individuals who are important to the child, consistent with the child’s best interests.(j)The child’s caregiver shall be provided a copy of a
				  plan outlining the child’s needs and services.(k)On or before June 30, 2008, the department, in consultation with the County Welfare Directors Association and other advocates, shall develop a comprehensive plan to ensure that 90 percent of foster children are visited by their caseworkers on a monthly basis by October 1, 2011, and that the majority of the visits occur in the residence of the child. The plan shall include any data reporting requirements necessary to comply with the provisions of the federal Child and Family Services Improvement Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-288).(l)The implementation and operation of the amendments to subdivision (i) enacted at the 2005–06 Regular Session shall be subject to appropriation through the budget process and by phase, as provided in Section 366.35.SEC. 11.SEC. 10. If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.
