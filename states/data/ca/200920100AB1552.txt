										Electricity. Water: coastal powerplants.Existing law establishes the policy of the state with respect to water quality as it relates to the coastal marine environment.This bill would provide that for a municipally owned coastal powerplant that is not new, as defined, the best available technology for a municipally owned powerplant shall be evaluated on a facility-wide basis using design flow. The bill would also provide that considerations regarding the feasibility of installing the best available technology shall rely on a specified definition of “feasibility.” The bill would require the State Water Resources Control Board’s statewide water quality control policy on the use of coastal and estuarine waters for powerplant cooling to allow municipally owned coastal powerplants to comply with certain
		requirements.The California Renewables Portfolio Standard Program requires the Public Utilities Commission to implement annual procurement targets for the procurement of eligible renewable energy resources, as defined, for all retail sellers, as defined, to achieve the targets and goals of the program. Existing law establishes a separate program under which retail suppliers of electricity disclose accurate, reliable, and simple to understand information on the generation attributes of the electricity they propose to sell, including eligible renewables, as
		defined. Existing law provides that a retail supplier that does not make any claims that identify its electricity sources as different than net system power, as defined, is authorized to disclose net system electricity sources.This bill would replace the term “retail supplier” with “retail seller” and would replace the term “eligible renewables” with “eligible renewable energy resources” in the later described program and would incorporate definitions for those terms that are applicable to the California Renewables Portfolio Standard Program. The bill would make other nonsubstantive changes.Digest Key
