						LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1072, Eng.
											  Public Transportation Modernization, Improvement, and Service Enhancement Account.Existing law, the Highway Safety, Traffic Reduction, Air Quality, and Port Security Bond Act of 2006, authorizes the issuance of $19.925 billion of general obligation bonds for transportation purposes, including $4 billion for allocation to various public transportation purposes. Of this amount, $3.6 billion is to be deposited in the Public Transportation Modernization, Improvement, and Service Enhancement Account (PTMISEA) for allocation, upon appropriation, to transit operators and other agencies for transit purposes. Existing law specifies the process for allocating available funds in the PTMISEA for those purposes appropriated in the Budget Act of 2008. Existing law makes these provisions inoperative on July 1, 2009, and repeals them on January 1, 2010.This bill would apply these provisions to funds appropriated for these purposes from the PTMISEA by the Budget Act of 2009 and subsequent fiscal years and would make
		other conforming changes. The bill would require eligible project sponsors to provide the Department of Transportation with project descriptions for each project they plan to fund with PTMISEA funds yet to be appropriated for the duration of the PTMISEA program, and would require the department to transmit that information to the Department of Finance. The bill would authorize a project sponsor to use an allocation in a subsequent fiscal year in order to complete projects that were approved in a previous fiscal year. The bill would authorize a project sponsor, in a particular fiscal year, to loan its allocation to another project sponsor with an identified eligible project under terms and conditions
		approved by the department. The bill would delete the inoperative and repeal dates, thereby extending the operation of these provisions indefinitely. This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.Digest Key

Funds allocated to project sponsors pursuant to this section shall
				  provide each project sponsor with the same proportional share of funds as the proportional share each received from the allocation of State Transit Assistance funds, pursuant to Sections 99313 and 99314 of the Public Utilities Code, over fiscal years 2004–05, 2005–06, and 2006–07. This formula shall apply to the remaining balance of funds in the PTMISEA program.(2) In establishing the amount of funding each project sponsor is eligible to receive from funds to be allocated based on Section 99313 of the Public Utilities Code, the Controller shall make the following computations:(A) For each project sponsor, compute the amounts of State Transit Assistance funds allocated to that entity pursuant to Section 99313 of the Public Utilities Code during the 2004–05, 2005–06, and 2006–07 fiscal years.(B) Compute the total
				  statewide allocation of State Transit Assistance funds pursuant to Section 99313 of the Public Utilities Code during the 2004–05, 2005–06, and 2006–07 fiscal years.(C) Divide subparagraph (A) by subparagraph (B).(D) For each project sponsor, multiply the allocation factor computed pursuant to subparagraph (C) by 50 percent of the amount appropriated for allocation from PTMISEA.(3) In establishing the amount of funding each project sponsor is eligible to receive from funds to be allocated based on Section 99314 of the Public Utilities Code, the Controller shall make the following computations:(A) For each project sponsor, compute the amounts of State Transit Assistance funds allocated to that entity pursuant to Section 99314 of the Public Utilities
				  Code during the 2004–05, 2005–06, and 2006–07 fiscal years.(B) Compute the total statewide allocation of State Transit Assistance funds pursuant to Section 99314 of the Public Utilities Code during the 2004–05, 2005–06, and 2006–07 fiscal years.(C) Divide subparagraph (A) by subparagraph (B).(D) For each project sponsor, multiply the allocation factor computed pursuant to subparagraph (C) by 50 percent of the amount appropriated for allocation from PTMISEA.(4) The Controller shall notify project sponsors of the amount of funding each is eligible to receive from the funds appropriated from PTMISEA in each fiscal year based on actual appropriations and the computations pursuant to subparagraph (D) of paragraph (2) and subparagraph (D) of paragraph
				  (3).(b) Prior to seeking a disbursement of funds for an eligible PTMISEA capital project, a project sponsor on the list developed pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) shall submit to the department a description of the proposed capital project or projects it intends to fund with PTMISEA funds in the current fiscal year.

				  project, or a minimum operable segment of the project, is, or will become, fully funded with an allocation of funds from the PTMISEA, and the funds can be encumbered within three years of the allocation based on the department’s review of the project’s phase or schedule for completion, as submitted by the project sponsor.(d) (1) Upon conducting the review required in subdivision (c) and determining the proposed projects to be in compliance with the requirements of that subdivision, the department shall biannually adopt a list of projects eligible for an allocation from the funds appropriated to the account in the applicable fiscal year.(2) Upon adoption of the list by the department, the department shall provide the list of projects eligible for funding in the current fiscal year to the Controller.(e) Upon receipt of the information required in subdivision (d), the Controller’s office shall commence any necessary actions to allocate funds to the project sponsors on the list of projects, including, but not limited to, seeking the issuance of bonds for that purpose.
