						LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1398, Blumenfield.
											  Technology-based materials.Existing law defines specified terms used in provisions of law related to instructional materials, including technology-based materials. Existing law defines technology-based materials as basic or supplemental instructional materials that are designed as learning resources and that require the availability of electronic equipment in order to be used. However, the technology-based materials do not include the electronic equipment required to make use of those materials.This bill would revise the definition of technology-based materials to specify that they may include the electronic equipment required in order to use them if that equipment is to be used by pupils and teachers as a learning resource. This bill would provide that its provisions not be construed to relieve a school district of the obligation to provide pupils with sufficient textbooks or instructional materials, as specified. The bill would prohibit a
		school district from procuring this electronic equipment pursuant to the bill if a county office of education determines that the district is out of compliance with this obligation.Digest Key
