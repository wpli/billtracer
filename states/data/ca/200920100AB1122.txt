						Eng, Jones)February 27, 2009 An act to add Section 597.4 to the Penal Code, relating to animals. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1122, Lieu.
											  Animal abuse: sale of live animals.Existing law proscribes animal abuse, as specified, including the failure to maintain and care for the premises and animals at pet shops. Existing law also generally provides that a pet store shall not sell, offer for sale, trade, or barter any dog or cat that is under 8 weeks of age, and may sell, offer for sale, trade, or barter a dog or cat over 8 weeks of age only if the animal is weaned. This bill would provide, in addition and with specified exceptions, that it shall be a crime, punishable as specified, for any person to willfully sell, display or offer for sale or give away as part of a commercial transaction, a live animal on any street, highway, public right-of-way, parking lot, carnival, or boardwalk. The bill would provide that a notice describing the charge and the penalty for a violation of this bill may be issued by a peace officer, animal control officer, or humane officer. By
		creating a new crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.Digest Key
