						EmmersonFebruary 27, 2009 An act to amend Section 120335 of add Section 112046 to the Health and Safety Code, relating to immunizations food safety. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1021, as amended, Emmerson.
											  Immunizations. Food processing establishments: suspension.Under existing law, the California Food Sanitation Act, which is administered by the State Department of Public Health, a food processing establishment is required to satisfy prescribed sanitation requirements for purposes of food safety. A violation of these provisions is a misdemeanor.This bill would permit authorized agents of the department who identify conditions likely to result in illness or injury at a food processing establishment to immediately suspend the license or registration of the food processing establishment and order the food processing establishment to close immediately pending an administrative hearing. The bill would require the department to provide a licensee or registrant with a written notice that contains prescribed information about the suspension and administrative hearing.Existing law prohibits the governing authority of a school or other institution from unconditionally admitting any person as a pupil of any private or public elementary or secondary school, child care center, day nursery, nursery school, family day care home, or development center, unless prior to his or her first admission to that institution he or she has been fully immunized against various diseases, including hepatitis B and pertussis (whooping cough) as well as any other disease deemed appropriate by the State Department of Public Health, taking into consideration the recommendations of specified entities.This bill would add to these entities the American Academy of Family Physicians.This bill would also, remove certain of the immunization age and date restrictions.Because the bill would add to the duties of certain local
		agencies it would impose a state-mandated local program.The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.Digest Key
