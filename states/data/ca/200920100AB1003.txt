						LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1003, John A. Perez.
											  Domestic violence grants. Existing law establishes a grant program for the development and support of domestic violence programs and services for the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender community. Existing law requires the Office of Emergency Services (OES), renamed the California Emergency Management Agency (Cal EMA), to use funds from the Equality in Prevention and Services for Domestic Abuse Fund to award up to 4 grants annually to fund domestic violence programs and services for the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender community, including, but not limited to, all of the following: (1) 24-hour crisis hotlines, (2) counseling, (3) court and social service advocacy, (4) legal assistance with temporary restraining orders, devices, and custody disputes, (5) community resource and referral, (6) household establishment assistance, (7) emergency housing, and (8) educational workshops and publications.This bill would
		revise that provision to instead specify that the Cal EMA shall award grants annually to fund domestic violence intervention, education, and prevention programs and services for that community, including, but not limited to, any of the components described above as well as batterers intervention and warmlines. Existing law provides that organizations reapplying for grants under the grant program described above shall not be subject to a competitive grant process, but shall be subject to a request for application process. Existing law also provides that any organization funded through this program in the previous grant cycle shall be funded upon reapplication, except as specified.This bill would delete the above provisions and would provide that grant recipients shall be required to provide at
		least 10% matching funds, unless this requirement is waived by the Secretary of Cal EMA. The bill would also require grant recipients, as a condition of receiving funding, to ensure that appropriate staff and volunteers having client contact meet the definition of “domestic violence counselor” as specified by other existing law. This bill would additionally require the Cal EMA to consult with the State Department of Public Health to consider consolidation of their respective domestic violence programs, as specified, and to report its conclusions to the Legislature no later than June 30, 2011. The bill would make other related changes to those provisions.Digest Key

                                NO  Bill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. Section 13823.17 of the Penal Code is amended to read:13823.17. (a) The Legislature finds the problem of domestic violence in the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender community to be of serious and increasing magnitude. The Legislature also finds that existing domestic violence services for this population are underfunded and that members of this population are unserved or underserved in the state. Therefore, it is the intent of the Legislature that a goal of the California Emergency Management Agency (Cal EMA) shall be to increase access to domestic violence education, prevention, and services specifically for the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender community.(b) The goal of this
				  section is to establish a targeted or directed grant program for the development and support of domestic violence programs and services for the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender community. The Cal EMA shall use funds from the Equality in Prevention and Services for Domestic Abuse Fund to award grants annually to qualifying organizations, with at least one in southern California and one in northern California, to fund domestic violence programs and services that are specific to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community, including, but not limited to, any of the following:(1) Counseling.(2) Legal assistance with temporary restraining orders, devices, and custody disputes.(3) Court and social service advocacy.(4) Batterers
				  intervention.(5) Educational workshops and publications.(6) Community resource and referral.(7) Emergency housing.(8) Hotline or warmline.(9) Household establishment assistance.(c) Each grant shall be awarded for a three-year term, as funds are available, for the purposes of this section.(d) In order to be eligible to receive funds under this section, qualified organizations shall
				  provide matching funds of at least 10 percent of the funds to be received under the section unless this requirement is waived by the Secretary of Cal EMA, at his or her discretion.(e) As a condition of receiving funding pursuant to this section, grant recipients shall ensure that appropriate staff and volunteers having client contact meet the definition of “domestic violence counselor,” as specified in subdivision (a) of Section 1037.1 of the Evidence Code. The minimum training specified in paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 1037.1 of the Evidence Code shall be provided to those staff and volunteers who do not meet the requirements of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 1037.1 of the Evidence Code.(f) In order to qualify for a grant award under this section, the recipient shall be a California nonprofit organization with a demonstrated history of working in the area of domestic violence intervention, education, and prevention and serving the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community.(g) The funding process for distributing grant awards to qualifying organizations shall be administered by the Cal EMA as follows:(1) Grant funds shall be awarded to qualifying organizations as a result of a competitive request for proposal (RFP) process. The RFP process shall comply with all applicable state and federal statutes and to the extent possible, the response to the RFP shall not exceed 15 narrative pages, excluding attachments.(2) The following
				  criteria shall be used to evaluate grant proposals:(A) Whether the proposed program or services would further the purpose of promoting healthy, nonviolent relationships in the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community.(B) Whether the proposed program or services would reach a significant number of people in, and have the support of, the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community.(C) Whether the proposed program or services are grounded in a firm understanding of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender domestic violence and represent an innovative approach to addressing the issue.(D) Whether the proposed program or services would reach unique and underserved sectors of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community, such as
				  youth, people of color, immigrants, and transgender persons.(3) Grant funds shall not be used to support any of the following:(A) Scholarships.(B) Awards to individuals.(C) Out-of-state travel.(D) Projects that are substantially completed before the anticipated date of the grant award.(E) Fundraising activities.(h) Grant recipients may seek, receive, and make use of any funds that may be available from all public and private sources to augment any funds received pursuant to this section.(i) The Cal EMA may adopt rules as necessary to implement the grant program created under this section.(j) The Cal EMA may hire the support staff and utilize all resources necessary to carry out the purposes of this section.(k) The Cal EMA shall consult with the State Department of Public Health to consider the consolidation of their respective domestic violence programs and report conclusions to the Legislature no later than June 30, 2011.(l) For purposes of this section, “domestic violence” means the
				  infliction or threat of physical harm against past or present adult or adolescent intimate partners, including physical, sexual, and psychological abuse against the person, and is a part of a pattern of assaultive, coercive, and controlling behavior directed at achieving compliance from or control over that person.
