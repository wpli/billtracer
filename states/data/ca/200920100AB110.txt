						LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 110, Smyth.
											  Parks and open space: Rim of the Valley Trail Corridor: boundary revisions.(1) Existing law provides that, if the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy determines, based on relevant scientific information and land use planning studies, that a revision of the boundaries of the Rim of the Valley Trail Corridor in the vicinity of Placerita Canyon State Park east of Route 14, including Whitney Canyon, is necessary, the executive director of the conservancy is required to prepare and file with the Secretary of State and specified committees of the Legislature, a revised map showing the changes in the boundaries of the Rim of the Valley Trail Corridor.This bill, instead, would authorize the conservancy to revise the boundaries of the Rim of the Valley Trail Corridor in the vicinity of the City of Santa Clarita, including Whitney Canyon, Elsmere Canyon, and their adjacent watersheds. An owner of property located in Elsmere Canyon would be authorized to request of the conservancy
		that his or her property be included within the boundaries of the Rim of the Valley Trail Corridor. The conservancy, upon receipt of the request, would be authorized, in accordance with specified procedures, to revise the map showing the boundaries of the Rim of the Valley Trail Corridor to include the property in Elsmere Canyon that is the subject of the request. The bill would provide that the above authorization to the property owner would not affect inclusion of the property in the corridor pursuant to other provisions of law.(2) Existing law prohibits the provision related to the revision of boundaries of the Rim of the Valley Trail Corridor from being interpreted to affect any portion of Elsmere Canyon, or from affecting the decision of whether to permit Elsmere Canyon as a solid waste facility.The bill would delete that provision.(3) The bill also would make a technical, nonsubstantive change.Digest Key
