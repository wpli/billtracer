						V. Manuel PerezFebruary 27, 2009 An act to add Article 2.5 (commencing with Section 11570) to Chapter 6 of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, relating to boards and commissions. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1501, as introduced, V. Manuel Perez.
											  Boards and commission: salaries full time.Existing law specified the salaries of certain members of various state boards and commissions. This bill would require the salary of a board member, as defined, that is set by statute to be based on the board member serving full time and would require, if a board member does not work full time in any given month, to prorate the salary of that board member to the actual hours worked while serving as a board member. The bill would exclude from these requirements a board member who is paid a salary on or after January 1, 2010, of less than $100,000. The bill would require the Department of Personnel Administration to adopt regulations for determining which activities constitute service as a board member and the minimum number of hours required to deem a board member to be serving full time, which would be prohibited from being less than 160 hours per month.Digest Key
