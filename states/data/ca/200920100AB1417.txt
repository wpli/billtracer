						SmythFebruary 27, 2009 An act to amend Section 594 Sections 640.7 and 640.8 of the Penal Code, relating to vandalism. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1417, as amended, Smyth.
											  Vandalism.Existing law provides that any person who violates specified vandalism provisions on or within 100 feet of a highway or on a freeway, as specified, is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine or imprisonment or both a fine and imprisonment, as specified.This bill would increase the penalties for violations of these provisions. Because the bill would increase the penalties for a crime, it would impose a state-mandated local program.The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.Existing law, amended by Proposition 21, an initiative measure enacted by voters at the March 7, 2000, statewide primary election that requires a 23 vote of the Legislature to substantively amend, makes a person who maliciously commits any of specified destructive acts with respect to the real or personal property of another guilty of vandalism.This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to that provision.Digest Key

				  the amount of damage is five thousand dollars ($5,000) or more, by a minimum fine of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) and not more than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), or by both this fine and imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding six months.

				  of school attendance or employment.SEC. 3. No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.SECTION 1.Section 594 of the Penal Code is amended to read:594.(a)Every person who maliciously commits any of the following acts with respect to any real or personal property that is not his or her own, in cases other than those specified by state law, is guilty of vandalism:(1)Defaces with graffiti or other inscribed material.(2)Damages.(3)Destroys.Whenever a person violates this subdivision with respect to real property, vehicles, signs, fixtures, furnishings, or property belonging to any public entity,
				  as defined by Section 811.2 of the Government Code, or the federal government, it shall be a permissive inference that the person neither owned the property nor had the permission of the owner to deface, damage, or destroy the property.(b)(1)If the amount of defacement, damage, or destruction is four hundred dollars ($400) or more, vandalism is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison or in a county jail not exceeding one year, or by a fine of not more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000), or if the amount of defacement, damage, or destruction is ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or more, by a fine of not more than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), or by both that fine and imprisonment.(2)(A)If the amount of defacement, damage, or destruction is less than four hundred dollars ($400), vandalism is punishable by imprisonment in a
