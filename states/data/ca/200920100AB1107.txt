The bill would also require the agency to solicit public comment on the economic analysis in the same manner as on the proposed rule.The bill would allow any interested person, within 15 calendar days of the date of the public workshop or public hearing, to request the agency to submit the economic analysis to external peer review, and would prescribe procedures for conducting the external peer review.Digest Key
