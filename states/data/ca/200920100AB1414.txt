						LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1414, Hill.
											  Controlled substances: apomorphine: unscheduled.Existing law, the California Uniform Controlled Substances Act, classifies controlled substances into 5 designated schedules, with the most restrictive limitations generally placed on controlled substances classified in Schedule I, and the least restrictive limitations generally placed on controlled substances classified in Schedule V. Existing law places apomorphine within Schedule II.This bill would remove apomorphine from Schedule II of the California Uniform Controlled Substances Act and make it an unscheduled substance.Digest Key
