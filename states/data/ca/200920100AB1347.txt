											  Water resources: desalination.(1) Existing law, the Cobey-Porter Saline Water Conversion Law, authorizes the Department of Water Resources, either independently or in cooperation with public or private entities, to conduct a program of investigation, study, and evaluation in the field of saline water conversion, to provide assistance to persons or entities seeking to construct desalination facilities, and after submission of a written report and specific authorization from the Legislature, to finance, construct, and operate saline water conversion facilities. This bill would make a technical, nonsubstantive change to these provisions.(2) Existing law requires the department, not later than July 1, 2004, to report to the Legislature, on potential opportunities and impediments for using seawater and brackish water desalination, and to examine what role, if any, the
		state should play in furthering the use of desalination technology. Existing law requires the department to convene a Water Desalination Task Force, comprised of representatives from listed agencies and interest groups, to advise the department in carrying out these duties and in making recommendations to the Legislature.This bill would repeal these provisions.Digest Key
