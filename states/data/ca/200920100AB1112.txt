											  Hazardous waste: management. Public contracts: California State University: service contracts: foreign countries.Existing law establishes the California State University under the administration of the Trustees of the California State University. Existing law, known as the California State University Contract Law sets forth a process through which contracts for projects, as defined, that are entered into with respect to the California State University may be competitively bid, entered into, and executed.This bill would authorize the trustees to enter into a contract with the government of a foreign country to provide the services of California State University staff or personnel in that foreign country. The bill would require that any contract entered into by the trustees and the government of a foreign country, to the extent permitted by federal law, contain the following clauses: (1) a clause requiring that a contractor and its subcontractors shall be
		required to maintain a workplace that is free from harassment and discrimination against any employee on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, race, color, ancestry, religious creed, national origin, mental disability, physical disability, medical condition, age, marital status, or use of family care leave, (2) a clause requiring that a contractor and its subcontractors shall provide written assurance that they will comply with specified nondiscrimination laws and regulations in the contract, (3) a clause requiring that a contractor and any subcontractor subject to the requirements of the bill shall provide specified written notice to any labor organizations with which the contractor or subcontractor has a collective bargaining or other labor agreement, and (4) a clause requiring either that the foreign country make a specified waiver or that the contract is subject to specified laws.Existing law authorizes the Department of Toxic Substances Control to grant a variance from the requirements regulating the management of hazardous waste, if the department makes specified findings. Existing law also requires the department to classify as nonhazardous waste any fly ash, bottom ash, and flue gas emission control residues generated from a biomass combustion process, as specified.This bill would require the department, to the extent it does not violate federal law, to classify as nonhazardous waste petroleum contact water and petroleum tank bottoms and sludge, as defined.Digest Key
