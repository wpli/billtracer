						LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1246, Jones.
											   Workforce housing cooperative trust.(1) Existing law defines “limited-equity housing cooperative” to be a corporation that meets specified criteria. Existing law exempts a limited-equity housing cooperative from specified requirements for the regulation of transactions of subdivided lands.This bill would revise the definition of a “limited-equity housing cooperative” to also apply to a “workforce housing cooperative trust.” The bill would exempt an entity as so defined from these provisions governing the regulation of transactions of subdivided land if, among other organizations, the Federal Home Loan Bank System or any of its member institutions and school districts directly finance or subsidize at least 50% of the total construction or development cost or $100,000, whichever is less. The bill also would exempt such an entity from these provisions if the real property to be occupied by the cooperative was sold or leased by the
		Department of Transportation, other state agency, a city, a county, or a school district for the development of the cooperative and has a regulatory agreement, as specified.(2) Existing law defines “limited-equity housing cooperative” to mean a corporation organized on a cooperative basis that meets specified requirements.This bill would revise the definition of a “limited-equity housing cooperative” to also apply to a “workforce housing cooperative trust.” The bill would, except as provided, prohibit a board of directors from returning transfer value, either full or partial, to a member of the board while he or she still remains a member of the board, and would prohibit an existing member of the board of directors from accepting the return of his or her transfer value, either full or partial.
		The bill would authorize that, in any suit against a board of directors and its members based upon a breach of corporate or fiduciary duties or a failure to comply with specified requirements, a prevailing plaintiff recover reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. The bill would prohibit an organization formed under the act that uses public funds from using any corporate funds to avoid compliance with its provisions, and from pursuing dissolution if the intent or outcome is for the members to
		receive any payment in excess of the transfer value to which he or she is entitled, pursuant to specified law. The bill would impose procedural requirements relating to the dissolution of a limited-equity housing cooperative or workforce housing cooperative trust that receives or has received a public subsidy.This bill also would provide for the manner in which a workforce housing cooperative trust is organized and operated, as specified. The bill would make technical and conforming changes to existing law.Digest Key
