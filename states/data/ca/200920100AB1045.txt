						LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1045, John A. Perez.
											  HIV and AIDS reporting.Existing law establishes various programs for the prevention of disease and the promotion of health to be administered by the State Department of Public Health, including, but not limited to, programs related to HIV and AIDS testing and for the reporting of information relating to HIV or AIDS infection.Existing law requires each clinical laboratory, as defined, to report all CD4+ T-Cell test results to the local health officer within 7 days.This bill would, notwithstanding that requirement, allow a clinical laboratory to refrain from reporting a CD4±_T-Cell test result if the clinical laboratory can demonstrate that the CD4±_T-Cell test result is not related to a diagnosed case of HIV infection.Digest Key
