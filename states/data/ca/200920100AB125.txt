											  Retirement: California Employee Savings Program.Existing federal law provides for tax-qualified retirement plans and individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities by which private citizens may save money for retirement.This bill would create the California Employee Savings Program, which would be operative only upon a specified appropriation in the annual Budget Act or if sufficient funds are made available through a nonprofit or private entity or federal funding, as specified. The program would be administered by the Board of Administration of the Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS), with the intent of promoting greater retirement savings for California private employees in a convenient, low-cost, and portable manner. The bill would require the board, under this program, to offer one or more individual retirement accounts or defined benefit plans, as specified, to eligible employees of participating eligible employers, as defined. The bill
		would specify that eligible employees of participating employers are not members of PERS. The bill would permit the board, in initiating and administering the program, to, among other things, employ staff and 3rd-party administrators, as necessary, collaborate with various entities in the private sector, recover expenses from contributions or investment returns, as specified, and evaluate and establish the process by which eligible employees who want to contribute a portion of their paycheck to an account offered by the program are able to notify their employers and require the employer to forward the contribution and related information to the program. The bill would require the Employment Development Department to cooperate in this regard. The bill would authorize the Employment Development Department to charge a fee for any administrative costs it incurs by reason of implementing and administering the program. The bill would require the board to make reports to employers on the progress and status of the
		program.The bill would also require the board to make specified reports to the Legislature, including a report upon determining that all specified conditions necessary to implement the program can be satisfied, a report if it finds that the program is not self-sustaining, and annual reports on the status of the program, as specified. The bill would require PERS, after specified acts have occurred, to request funding through a Budget Act appropriation or from a nonprofit or private entity or from federal funding for the purpose of implementing the program. The bill would require the board to keep program funds and accounts separate from those of PERS and would prohibit the use of funds in PERS, as specified, to initiate, develop, implement, or administer the program. In addition, the bill would require that all expenses and obligations created by the program be funded by its contributions, returns, and assets, except as the Legislature may appropriate funds for this
		purpose, to be deposited in the California Employee Savings Program Administrative Fund, which this bill would establish as a continuously appropriated fund. The bill would require PERS to obtain the necessary approvals from federal authorities for the program’s implementation. The bill would prohibit any claim, tax lien, or other right of setoff from applying to funds or assets of the program, as specified. The bill would indemnify from the General Fund and hold harmless the present, former, and future board members, officers, employees of, and investment managers under contract with, PERS in connection with any decision or action related to the administration of the program. The bill would provide that the program may only be implemented if the board determines that certain conditions are satisfied, and would permit the board to discontinue the program on its determination, as specified. The bill would permit the board to adopt regulations in regard to the program, and would provide that the adoption,
		amendment, or repeal of a regulation is exempted from the rulemaking provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act. Subject to the availability of funds, as specified, the bill would require the board to report to Legislature regarding the feasibility of creating a defined benefit plan option to be available to employers. The bill would also make a statement of findings.Digest Key

                                NO  Bill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. The Legislature finds and declares the following:(a) Currently, 6 million Californians, 43 percent of the state’s workforce, work at a job that does not offer them a pension or retirement savings plan to supplement social security.(b) Social security payments alone, which average $1,081 per month in California, will not sustain Californians in their retirement. Seniors without savings may be more likely to require government assistance with housing, medical care, and other necessities.(c) Though investments in savings accounts have increased over time, investments from low-income small businesses, or
		  short-tenured and transient employees, are strikingly low and have not increased at the same rate.(d) Nationally, two out of three low-wage workers lack access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan, while only one in four high-wage workers do. Nearly 65 percent of low-income workers, those earning less than $40,000 per year, do not participate in employer plans, according to the Congressional Budget Office.(e) Only 26 percent of full-time, full-year private sector workers in businesses with fewer than 25 employees participated in a pension plan in 2004, compared with 69 percent of those employed by companies with 500 or more employees. Complexity and cost of administering retirement plans may prevent small companies, in comparison to larger corporations, from creating retirement plans for their employees.(f) Low investment participation rates in retirement plans can also be attributed to a worker losing coverage access after moving into a new job with a new business.(g) Workers today are spending more than they are saving, relying more on credit, and thus accruing debt and putting their future financial security at risk. Nationally, the personal savings rate for individuals has fallen to 0.5 percent of income for 2007. At this rate, even with social security benefits, Californians will not be able to afford retirement.(h) California workers without access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan need a seamless, lifelong savings system, providing them with the opportunity to build their assets and helping them to attain their financial stability and future through a secure, portable savings account.(i) Providing California workers with a guaranteed retirement income to supplement Social Security, traditionally funded by stable employer contributions via a defined-benefit employer-based pension plan, is optimal to ensure that workers accumulate the benefits they need for a secure retirement. California must continue to explore guaranteed replacement income programs, such as defined benefit plans, for working Californians. Establishing and offering a defined benefit plan would require additional study to research and address the complex policies and regulatory approvals necessary for creation and implementation, and would be an important step toward ensuring the retirement security for working Californians.(j) Though guaranteed retirement income programs are valuable savings tools for workers, given the changing needs and work habits of California’s workers, alone, they are insufficient to afford workers a comfortable and
		  secure retirement. California workers need additional retirement savings options to ensure their retirement security.(k) In creating an additional savings program for its workers, California would supplement existing savings options, assisting California’s working men and women to save for retirement. This program would be funded by the program’s participants and would be maintained and administered at no cost to taxpayers.(l) The California Employee Savings Program is hereby established by this act to promote expanded retirement security for working Californians’ employers’ sponsorship of retirement plans for their employees.SEC. 2. Title 25 (commencing with Section 100000) is added to the Government Code, to read:TITLE 25. CALIFORNIA EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PROGRAM100000. For purposes of this title:(a) “Board” means the Board of Administration of the Public Employees’ Retirement System.(b) “Eligible employer” means a person or entity engaged in a business, industry, profession, trade, or other enterprise in the state, whether for profit or not for profit, but excluding the state, any county, any municipal corporation, or any of its units or instrumentalities, and that satisfies the requirements to establish or participate in a SIMPLE IRA or a payroll deposit IRA arrangement. An eligible employer does not include any employer to the extent that the employer replaces a preexisting retirement plan with a
					 an arrangement provided for by this title.(c) “Eligible employee” means a person who is an employee of an eligible employer.(d) “ERISA” means the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.(e) “IRA” means an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity under Section 408, 408A, or 408(p) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.(f) “Participating employer” means an eligible employer that maintains or participates in an IRA arrangement provided for by this title for eligible employees.(g) “Payroll deposit IRA arrangement”
					 means an arrangement by which an employer makes its payroll system available to employees as a conduit for transferring salary reduction contributions to IRAs.(h) “Program” means the California Employee Savings Program established by this title.(i) “SIMPLE IRA” means a SIMPLE IRA program under Section 408(p) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.(j) “System” means the Public Employees’ Retirement System. 100002. (a) There is hereby established a retirement savings program known as the California Employee Savings Program to be administered by the board with the intent of promoting greater retirement savings for California private employees in a convenient, low-cost, and portable manner.

					 outreach to eligible employers and eligible employees.(d) Cause expenses incurred to initiate, implement, maintain, and administer the program to be paid from contributions to, or investment returns or assets of, the program or IRAs IRA plans or arrangements established under the program, to the extent permitted under federal law, except for expenditures that are provided for through appropriations from the Legislature.(e) Facilitate compliance by the IRAs IRA plans or
					 arrangements established under the program with all applicable requirements for the plans under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, including tax qualification requirements or any other applicable law and accounting requirements, including providing or arranging for assistance to plan sponsors and individuals in complying with applicable law and tax qualification requirements in a cost-effective manner.(f) Cause the IRA plans or arrangements established under the program to be designed, established, and operated:(1) In accordance with best practices for retirement savings vehicles.(2) To maximize participation,
					 saving, and sound investment practices, and to encourage the use of automatic features, including, but not limited to, automatic enrollment and appropriate selection of default investments.(3) With simplicity, ease of administration for participating employers, and portability of benefits.(g) Seek to minimize costs by assisting or facilitating the pooling of small employers and individuals in purchasing IRAs, IRA plans or arrangements, and investments, and through economies of scale, standardization, designation of investment types, and other measures.(h) Arrange for collective, common, and pooled investment of assets of the IRA arrangements, including investment in conjunction with other funds with which those assets are permitted to be collectively invested, with a view to saving costs through efficiencies and economies of scale, but only to the extent that these collective investment arrangements would not jeopardize or alter the current exemptions from ERISA and federal securities laws of the plans maintained by the system and administered by the board for state and local government employers and employees. Nothing in this subdivision shall adversely affect or otherwise compromise the system’s ability to comply with applicable federal and state law and conditions for favorable tax treatment.(i) Disseminate educational information concerning saving and planning for retirement.(j) Disseminate information
					 concerning the tax credits available to small business owners for establishing new retirement plans and the federal saver’s tax credit available to moderate- and lower income households for saving in plans and IRAs IRA plans or arrangements.(k) Submit progress and status reports to participating employers and eligible employees.(l) If necessary, determine the eligibility of an employer, employee, or other individual to participate in the program.(m) Evaluate and establish the process by which eligible employees of participating employers who want to contribute a portion of their
					 paycheck to an account offered by the program are able to notify their employers, either at the time of hiring or thereafter, and require the participating employer to forward the employee contribution and related information to the program or its agents, provided, however, the board shall not be responsible for ensuring employer compliance in executing requests by eligible employees to participate in the program. This may include, but is not limited to, the ability to use the current tax processing and accounting system of the Employment Development Department, financial services companies, and third-party administrators with the capability to receive and process employee information and contributions for payroll deduction IRA arrangements or other retirement savings
					 IRA plans or arrangements authorized by this title.
