						LieuFebruary 27, 2009 An act to amend Sections 8203 and 8600 of the Elections Code, relating to elections. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1335, Lieu.
											  Elections: write-in candidates.Existing law requires that write-in candidates submit a statement to the appropriate elections official containing specified information about their candidacy.This bill would require that a write-in candidate for the office of superior court judge include on the statement his or her compliance with certain eligibility provisions for a judge of a court of record.Existing law requires a petition to be signed by a certain number of qualified registered voters when a write-in campaign will be conducted for the office of superior court judge if only the incumbent files nomination papers.This bill would revise the number of qualified registered voter signatures required to be on these petitions.This bill would also incorporate changes to Section 8600 of the Elections Code made by SB 6, to become
		operative only if both this bill and SB 6 become operative.Because the bill would change the duties of local elections officials, it would impose a state-mandated local program.The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.Digest Key
