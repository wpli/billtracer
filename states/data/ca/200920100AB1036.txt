						NielloFebruary 27, 2009 An act to amend Section Sections 326.3 and 326.4 of the Penal Code, relating to bingo. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1036, as amended, Niello.
											  Bingo: electronic devices: mitigation payments. Bingo.The California Constitution allows the Legislature, by statute, to authorize cities and counties to provide for bingo games for charitable purposes. Existing statutory law permits cities and counties to allow bingo games to be conducted by specified organizations for charitable purposes, and also permits cities and counties to allow remote caller bingo games, as defined. Existing Existing law allows a maximum of 10 unaffiliated organizations to enter into an agreement to cosponsor a remote caller bingo game if the game does not have more than 10 locations.This bill would, instead, allow a maximum of 100 unaffiliated
		organizations to enter into an agreement to cosponsor a remote caller bingo game if the game does not have more than 100 locations. Existing law prohibits electronics or video displays from being used in connection with the game of bingo, except as specified.Existing law establishes the Charity Bingo Mitigation Fund, administered by the California Gambling Control Commission, for the purpose of making payments to specified nonprofit organizations that, as of July 1, 2008, used electronic devices other than card-minding devices to conduct bingo games. Existing law requires an organization applying for mitigation payments to provide proof that its board of directors has adopted a resolution and its chief executive officer has signed a statement executed under penalty
		of perjury stating that, as of January 1, 2009, the organization has ceased using electronic devices, other than card-minding devices, as a fundraising tool. Existing law allows each eligible organization to apply to the commission no later than January 31, 2009, for the mitigation payments.This bill would, with respect to an organization applying for mitigation payments from the Charity Bingo Mitigation Fund, extend the date by which that organization must have ceased using electronic devices to October 1, 2010 2009. The bill would also extend the deadline for applying to the commission for mitigation payments to October 31, 2010
