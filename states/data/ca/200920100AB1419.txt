											  School districts. districts: reorganization of large districts.Under existing law, the process of school district reorganization begins with the submission of a petition that is reviewed by the county superintendent of schools and, if sufficient, forwarded to the county committee on school district organization and State Board of Education for additional review and public hearings. The county committee on school district organization is authorized to formulate plans and recommendations for the reorganization of school districts. The reorganization, if approved by the county committee or the State Board of Education, is required to be voted upon during the next available regular election. The reorganization plans are also required to meet specified requirements and the reorganization plans for school districts with more than 500,000 pupils based on average daily attendance are required to satisfy additional conditions.This bill instead would require, by July 1, 2013, the reorganization of a unified school district with an annual enrollment of more than 500,000 pupils into multiple school districts enrolling no more than 50,000 pupils. A school district reorganization commission would be established to aid in the reorganization process and develop a reorganization plan. The budget of the commission would be limited to a fixed amount drawn from the administrative budget for the existing school district, without reducing funds used for classroom education. The bill would require the reorganization plan to demonstrate that certain specified conditions have been met with regard to the formation of the new school districts.Administrative costs in the new school districts would be limited to the percentage of total funds used for those purposes in the existing school district 2 years prior to reorganization. Pupils from the existing school
		district would be permitted to attend school in any new school district if space is available. The existing school district would be prohibited from entering into a contract with terms extending beyond July 1, 2013. The commission would be required to report to the Legislature annually on the progress of the reorganization.By requiring school districts with specified pupil enrollment to reorganize, this bill would impose a state‑mandated local program.The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory
		provisions.Existing law provides that an action to reorganize one or more school districts is initiated upon the filing of a petition with the county superintendent of schools signed by specified persons.This bill would make several technical, nonsubstantive changes to those provisions.Digest Key
