						LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1368, Adams.
											  Child day care: safety.Under existing law, the State Department of Public Health licenses and regulates child day care centers and family day care homes. Existing law requires day care center directors and licensees of large family day care homes to ensure that at least one staff member who has a current course completion in pediatric first aid and pediatric CPR, as specified, is onsite when children are present and is present with the children when they are offsite for facility activities. Willful or repeated violation of these provisions is a misdemeanor.This bill would make the above provision applicable to all family day care homes. By enlarging the scope of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies
		and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.Digest Key

Sec. 12101 et seq.).(h) The department shall adopt regulations to implement this section.SEC. 2. No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.
