An act to add and repeal Article 11.3 (commencing with Section 18810) of Chapter 3 of Part 10.2 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to taxpayer contributions.LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1008, as amended, Block.
											  Community colleges: student assessment. Taxpayer contributions: California National Guard Education Assistance Fund.Provisions relating to the administration of personal income taxes allow individual taxpayers to contribute amounts in excess of their tax liability for the support of specified funds.This bill would allow taxpayers to designate on their tax returns that a specified amount in excess of their tax liability be transferred to the California National Guard Education Assistance Fund, which would be created by this bill. However, the bill would provide that a voluntary contribution designation for this fund may not be added on the tax return until another voluntary contribution designation is removed from that return.This bill would require that all moneys contributed to the fund pursuant to these provisions, upon appropriation by the Legislature, be allocated to the Franchise Tax Board
		and to the Controller for allocation to the California National Guard Education Assistance Fund, as provided.This bill would provide that these voluntary contribution provisions are repealed on January 1 of the 5th taxable year following the taxable year the fund first appears on the tax return. The bill would further provide that these provisions are repealed for taxable years beginning on or after January 1 of the calendar year in which the Franchise Tax Board estimates by September 1 that the contributions made on returns filed in that calendar year will be less than $250,000, or an adjusted amount for subsequent taxable years.Existing law establishes the California Community Colleges, under the administration of the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, as one of the segments of public postsecondary education in this state.Existing law requires the board to implement matriculation services in as many community colleges as funds appropriated for that purpose allow. Among the matriculation services to be provided is the assessment and counseling of students upon enrollment. Under existing law, assessment includes the administration of assessment tests to determine competency in certain skill areas, identification of aptitudes, and evaluation of study and learning skills, among other things.Existing law prohibits a district or college from using an assessment instrument without authorization of the board and requires the board to establish an advisory committee to review and make recommendations
		concerning all assessment instruments used by the districts and colleges. Existing law provides that these requirements are only operative if funds are specifically appropriated for these purposes.This bill would require the board to convene a working group including representatives of the Legislative Analyst’s Office, the Academic Senate for California Community Colleges, and the California Community Colleges Consultation Council to make findings and recommendations regarding assessments that can be utilized to test basic skills of students entering community college. The bill would require the working group to present its findings to the Legislature and Governor on or before July 1, 2010.Digest Key
