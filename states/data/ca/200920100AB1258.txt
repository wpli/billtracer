											  Foster youth services.Under existing law, 6 unified school districts and consortia operating children’s services program sites that provide instruction, counseling, tutoring, and related services for foster children receive an allowance from the State School Fund. Existing law also authorizes county offices of education, or consortia of county offices of education, to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for grant funding, to the extent funds are available, to operate an education-based foster youth services program to provide educational and support services for foster children who reside in a licensed foster home or county-operated juvenile detention facility.This bill would delete the requirement that the education-based foster youth services program referenced above be limited to foster children who reside in a licensed foster home or county-operated juvenile detention facility.Digest Key
