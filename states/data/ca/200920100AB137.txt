						JeffriesJanuary 20, 2009 An act to amend Section 54952 of the Government Code, relating to open meetings. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 137, as introduced, Jeffries.
											  Open meetings: advisory committees.The Ralph M. Brown Act requires that all meetings of a legislative body, as defined, of a local agency be open and public and all persons be permitted to attend unless a closed session is authorized. In defining a legislative body for this purpose, the act excludes advisory committees composed solely of the members of the legislative body that are less than a quorum of the legislative body.This bill would limit this exclusion from the act to an advisory committee composed solely of the members of the legislative body that are less than a quorum of the legislative body and whose subject matter jurisdiction has cumulatively lasted for 2 years or less.Digest Key
