						LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 138, Hayashi.
											  Accounting firms: peer review.Existing law provides for the licensing and regulation of certified public accountants and other licensees by the California Board of Accountancy. Existing law requires an accounting firm providing attest services, with certain exceptions, to complete a peer review every 3 years in order to renew its registration, if the board, prior to September 1, 2011, determines that a peer review program should be implemented and identifies the resources necessary for that implementation.This bill would instead impose a peer review requirement for all accounting firms relative to accounting and auditing practice, which would be conducted by a board-recognized peer review program. The bill would require the board to adopt emergency regulations as necessary to implement the program and to adopt, by January 1, 2010, regulations defining a substandard peer review report. The bill would require an accounting firm and a peer review
		program provider to file copies of substandard peer review reports with the board. The bill would also require the board to appoint a peer review oversight committee, as specified. The bill would require the board to provide a report to the Legislature and Governor, by January 1, 2013, that includes specified information on the impact of these peer review requirements on certain small firms and sole practitioners. The bill would specify that these provisions shall become inoperative on January 1, 2014, unless a later enacted statute, enacted prior to that date, deletes or extends that date.
		The bill would also make specified findings and declarations of the Legislature regarding the value of peer review.Digest Key

		  professional standards.(d) Firms that complete a peer review will be better equipped to perform quality accounting and auditing engagements.(e) By completing a peer review, quality control systems can be designed or refined to ensure that work is performed in conformity with professional standards and that licensees develop and refine their technical skills.(f) Mandatory peer review demonstrates the board’s commitment to enhance the quality of the services provided by accounting firms and contributes to the public’s confidence in the profession.(g) Consumer confidence is paramount to a healthy economy. Consumer confidence is achieved in the field of accounting when consumers feel that the firms providing them with accounting and auditing services
		  are doing so in accordance with professional standards.SEC. 2. Section 5076 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read:5076. (a) In order to renew its registration, a firm, as defined in Section 5035.1, shall have a peer review report of its accounting and auditing practice accepted by a board-recognized peer review program no less frequently than every three years.(b) For purposes of this article, the following definitions apply:(1) “Peer review” means a study, appraisal, or review conducted in accordance with professional standards of the professional work of a firm by an individual who has a valid and current license, certificate, or permit to practice public accountancy from this state or another state and is unaffiliated with the firm being reviewed, and may include an

				  1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code) to establish policies, guidelines, and procedures as outlined in subdivision (c). The adoption of the regulations shall be considered by the Office of Administrative Law to be necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety, or general welfare. The emergency regulations shall be submitted to the Office of Administrative Law for filing with the Secretary of State and publication in the California Code of Regulations, and shall be replaced in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act.(e) Nothing in this section shall prohibit the board from initiating an investigation and imposing discipline against

(m) A peer reviewer shall not disclose information concerning licensees or their clients obtained during a peer review, unless specifically authorized pursuant to this section, Section 5076.1, or regulations prescribed by the board.(n) By January 1, 2013, the board shall provide the Legislature
				  and Governor with a report regarding the peer review requirements of this section that includes, without limitation:(1) The extent to which mandatory peer review of small firms or sole practitioners that prepare nondisclosure compiled financial statements on an other comprehensive basis of accounting enhances consumer protection.(2) The impact of peer review required by this section on small firms and sole practitioners that prepare nondisclosure complied financial statements on an other comprehensive basis of accounting.(3) The impact of peer review required by this section on small businesses, nonprofit corporations, and other entities that utilize small firms or sole practitioners for the purposes of nondisclosure compiled financial statements prepared on an other comprehensive basis of accounting.(o) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2014, and as of

Failure of a board-recognized peer review program provider to respond to the committee shall result in referral by the committee of the provider to the board for further
				  action. Any information obtained by the board, its representatives, or the peer review oversight committee in conjunction with its review of peer review program providers shall not be a public record, and shall be exempt from public disclosure, provided, however, this information may be disclosed under any of the following circumstances:(1) In connection with disciplinary proceedings of the board.(2) In connection with legal proceedings in which the board is a party.(3) In response to an official inquiry by a federal or state governmental regulatory agency.(4) In compliance with a subpoena or summons enforceable by court order.(5) As otherwise specifically required by law.(c) The members of the committee shall be appointed to two-year terms and may serve a maximum of four consecutive terms.(d) The board may adopt, as necessary, regulations further defining the minimum qualifications for appointment as a committee member and additional administrative elements designed to ensure the effectiveness of mandatory peer review.(e) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2014, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2014, deletes or extends that date.
