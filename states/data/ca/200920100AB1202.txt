											  University of California Center for Pest Research. Department of Water Resources: water usage and efficiency study. Existing law requires the Department of Water Resources to prepare and update, every 5 years, the California Water Plan, which is the plan for the orderly and coordinated control, protection, conservation, development, and use of the water resources of the state.This bill would require the department to study whether the Legislature should establish a statewide water usage and water efficiency measuring system.Existing law provides for various research programs for pest control and eradication and for their funding, including the University of California Pest Research Act of 1990, under which the Regents of the University of California are requested to establish the University of California Center for Pest Research to review and prioritize pest-related research conducted through the university, to award pest research funds, to develop a list of recommended pest management research priorities, and to prepare an annual report relating to the activities of the center for submittal to the Legislature.This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to these provisions.Digest Key

                                NO  Bill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. Section 143 is added to the Water Code, to read:143. The department shall study whether the Legislature should establish a statewide water usage and water efficiency measuring system, and shall report its findings by January 1, 2012.SECTION 1.Section 577 of the Food and Agricultural Code is amended to read:577.(a)The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:(1)There is a need to develop and apply ecologically based pest management alternatives that are environmentally sound to prevent, control, and eradicate pests.(2)The continuation of pest control technology in agriculture which relies primarily on synthetic chemicals may be impractical, given the dwindling number of newly registered chemicals, increasing resistance of numerous pests to pesticides, public concern about pesticide residues, and potential threats posed to environmental quality and human health.(3)To be adequately prepared for existing and new infestations of agricultural pests, California needs to have a means of coordinating and evaluating
				  long-term basic and applied pest research, including the impact of prevention, control, and eradication efforts upon public health and the environment.(4)The state should facilitate, promote, and support collaborative pest research programs and projects by its agencies, public and private universities, the federal government, and the agricultural industry that work toward developing environmentally sound, ecologically based pest management techniques.(5)In order to strengthen pest prevention, control, and eradication efforts, it is the intent of the Legislature that an administrative structure be created within the University of California which, in cooperation with California’s public and private universities, the state, the agricultural industry, and persons experienced with environmentally sound, ecologically based pest management alternatives, advances pest research and formulates innovative solutions that better safeguard the environment and public health.(b)(1)Toward these ends, the Legislature requests that the Regents of the University of California establish a pest
				  research center which will review and prioritize pest-related research activities conducted through the university.(2)It is the intent of the Legislature that University of California programs engaged in pest research shall, when applicable, follow the research priorities established by the center.(3)The center is encouraged to develop
				  research priorities in cooperation with other public and private universities and with state, federal, and county agencies, including, but not limited to, the Department of Food and Agriculture, State Department of Health Services, Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, county agricultural commissioners, United States Department of Agriculture, National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, and the agricultural industry, and with environmental and public and occupational health groups.
