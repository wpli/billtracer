						Runner)February 27, 2009 An act to add Section 3020.5 3103.7 to the Elections Code, relating to elections. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1367, as amended, Fletcher.
											  Elections: vote by mail ballots. Existing law requires that a vote by mail ballot be received by the issuing elections official or the precinct board no later than the close of polls on election day.This bill would make an exception for absent uniformed services special absentee voters, as defined, temporarily living outside of the territorial limits of the United States or the District of Columbia and would instead require that their vote by mail ballot be postmarked or signed and dated by the voter on or before election day and received by their elections official not later than 21 days after election day.Because
		the bill would impose additional duties on elections officials, it would impose a state-mandated local program.The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.Digest Key
