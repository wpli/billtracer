						FurutaniFebruary 27, 2009 An act to amend Section 1276.5 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to health facilities. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1038, as introduced, Furutani.
											  Health facilities: nursing hours.Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of health facilities by the State Department of Public Health. A violation of these provisions is a crime. Existing law requires that the minimum number of actual nursing hours per patient required in a skilled nursing facility shall be 3.2 hours, with specified exceptions.This bill would increase this requirement to 3.5 nursing hours per patient. By expanding the scope of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a
		specified reason.Digest Key

However, notwithstanding Section 14110.7 of the Welfare and Institutions Code or any other provision of law, commencing law:(1) Commencing January 1, 2000, the minimum number of actual nursing hours per patient required in a skilled nursing facility shall be 3.2 hours, except as provided in Section 1276.9.(2) Commencing January 1, 2010, the minimum number of actual nursing hours per patient required in a skilled nursing facility shall be 3.5 hours, except as provided in Section 1276.9.(b) (1) For the purposes of this section, “nursing hours” means the number of hours of work performed per patient day by aides, nursing assistants, or orderlies plus two times the number of hours worked per patient day by
				  registered nurses and licensed vocational nurses (except directors of nursing in facilities of 60 or larger capacity) and, in the distinct part of facilities and freestanding facilities providing care for the developmentally disabled or mentally disordered, by licensed psychiatric technicians who perform direct nursing services for patients in skilled nursing and intermediate care facilities, except when the skilled nursing and intermediate care facility is licensed as a part of a state hospital, and except that nursing hours for skilled nursing facilities means the actual hours of work, without doubling the hours performed per patient day by registered nurses and licensed vocational nurses.(2) Concurrent with implementation of the first year of rates established under the Medi-Cal Long Term Care Reimbursement Act of 1990 (Article 3.8 (commencing with Section 14126) of Chapter 7 of Part 3 of Division 9 of the Welfare and Institutions Code),
				  for the purposes of this section, “nursing hours” means the number of hours of work performed per patient day by aides, nursing assistants, registered nurses, and licensed vocational nurses (except directors of nursing in facilities of 60 or larger capacity) and, in the distinct part of facilities and freestanding facilities providing care for the developmentally disabled or mentally disordered, by licensed psychiatric technicians who performed direct nursing services for patients in skilled nursing and intermediate care facilities, except when the skilled nursing and intermediate care facility is licensed as a part of a state hospital.(c) Notwithstanding Section 1276, the department shall require the utilization of a registered nurse at all times if the department determines that the services of a skilled nursing and intermediate care facility require the utilization of a registered nurse.(d) (1) Except as otherwise provided by law, the administrator of an intermediate care facility/developmentally disabled, intermediate care facility/developmentally disabled habilitative, or an intermediate care facility/developmentally disabled—nursing shall be either a licensed nursing home administrator or a qualified mental retardation professional as defined in Section 483.430 of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations.(2) To qualify as an administrator for an intermediate care facility for the developmentally disabled, a qualified mental retardation professional shall complete at least six months of administrative training or demonstrate six months of experience in an administrative capacity in a licensed health facility, as defined in Section 1250, excluding those facilities specified in subdivisions (e), (h), and (i).SEC. 2. No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.
