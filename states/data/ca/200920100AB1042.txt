		grading, or pedestrian access.(2) Existing law authorizes the governing board of an elementary, high school, or unified school district, following notification by a local planning agency of a proposed action to adopt or substantially amend a general plan, to request a meeting with the planning agency to discuss possible methods of coordinating planning, design, and construction of new school facilities and schoolsites in coordination with the existing or planned infrastructure, general plan, and zoning designations of the city and county, as specified.

		adopt or substantially amend its general plan, to request a meeting with the planning agency to discuss possible methods of coordinating planning, design, and construction of new school facilities and schoolsites in coordination with the existing or planned infrastructure, general plan, and zoning designations of the city and county, as specified. The bill would require the planning agency to meet with the school district within 15 days following the notification by the planning agency without regard to whether a meeting was requested by the school district. By adding to the duties of school district and local planning agency officials, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.(3) Existing law requires the governing board of a school district, at least 45 days prior to completion of a school facility needs analysis, a master plan, or other long-range plan that relates to the potential expansion of existing schoolsites or the
		necessity to acquire additional schoolsites, to notify the planning commission or agency of the city or county with land use jurisdiction within the school district and to provide copies of any relevant and available information, master plan, or other long-range plan that relates to the potential expansion of school schoolsites or the necessity to acquire additional schoolsites.

		the school district without regard to whether a meeting was requested by the city, county, or city and county. By adding to the duties of school district and city, county, or city and county officials, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.(4) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.Existing law authorizes cities and counties to make and enforce within their limits all local police, sanitary, and other ordinances not in conflict with general laws.This bill would declare the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation that would require school districts to comply with city and county ordinances relating to drainage and road improvements and conditions when constructing new school facilities.Digest Key
