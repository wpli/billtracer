											  Public health: hepatitis B. Income tax: overpayment: interest.Existing law provides, with respect to the administration of the personal income tax, for the payment of interest on overpayments of tax in limited circumstances.This bill would require, if the Controller determines that moneys in the General Fund are insufficient for the payment of all appropriations by the Legislature which are required to be paid in the then fiscal year out of the General Fund and, because of that determination, postpones the issuance of refund warrants, the Controller to pay interest on refunds that are delayed by the Controller’s postponement of the issuance of refund warrants. The bill would specify the adjusted annual rate for payment of the interest, the time period over which the interest is to be calculated, and that the provisions of the bill would apply to all refund warrants postponed after February 1, 2009. By
		authorizing the Controller to expend a specified amount of money for the purpose of paying interest on overpayments of tax under specified circumstances without regard to fiscal year, this bill would make an appropriation.The bill would make a legislative finding and declaration regarding the public purpose served by the bill.Under existing law, persons are required to be immunized against specified communicable diseases prior to admission to daycare institutions or schools. Existing law requires immunization against hepatitis B for all students unconditionally entering or unconditionally advancing to the 7th grade level on or after July 1, 1999.Existing law requires the State Department of Public Health, in consultation with, the Trustees of the California State University, and the Regents of the University of California, to adopt and enforce regulations relating to the immunization of first-time enrollees at the institutions against the hepatitis B virus.Existing law requires, with prescribed exceptions, the Trustees of the California State University, and the Regents of the University of California, to the extent the regents act by resolution to make this bill applicable to the university, that
		first-time enrollees who are 18 years of age or younger provide proof of full immunization against the hepatitis B virus, prior to enrollment.Existing law establishes the Office of Multicultural Health in the department in order to perform specified functions.This bill would require the Immunization branch of the State Department of Public Health, after consulting with the Office of Multicultural Health, to create a public outreach campaign, including the creation of an informational Internet Web site, to educate citizens of the state with Asian, Southeast Asian, or Pacific Islander backgrounds on the importance of immunization against hepatitis B.Digest Key
