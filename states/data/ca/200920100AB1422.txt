						LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1422, Bass.
											  Health care programs: California Children and Families Act of 1998.Existing law imposes various taxes, including a tax at a specified rate on the gross premiums of an insurer, as defined.Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which health care services are provided to qualified low-income recipients. One of the methods by which these services are provided is pursuant to contracts with various types of managed care plans.This bill would, until January 1, 2011, impose that tax on the total operating revenue, as specified, of a Medi-Cal managed care plan, as defined. The proceeds from the tax would be continuously appropriated (1) to the department for purposes of the Medi-Cal program in an amount equal to 38.41% of the proceeds from the tax and (2) to the Managed Risk Medical Insurance Board for purposes of the Healthy Families Program in an amount equal to 61.59% of
		the proceeds from the tax.The bill would provide that the tax on Medi-Cal managed care plans would have no force or effect if any of specified conditions apply.Existing law requires every return required to be filed with the State Insurance Commissioner pursuant to provisions governing taxes on the gross premiums of insurers to be signed by the insurer or an executive officer of the insurer and to be made under oath or contain a written declaration that it is made under penalty of perjury.This bill would also require Medi-Cal managed care plans to file returns with the commissioner under oath or with a written declaration that is made under penalty of perjury. By expanding the crime of perjury, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.Existing law creates the Healthy Families Program, administered by the Managed Risk
		Medical Insurance Board, to arrange for the provision of health care services to children less than 19 years of age who meet certain criteria, including having a limited gross household income. Existing law requires families with children participating in the program to pay specified family contribution amounts.This bill would, commencing November 1, 2009, increase the amounts to be paid for the family contributions. This bill would require the Healthy Families Program to provide prior notice to any applicant for a subscriber whose premium will increase as a result of the increases in the family contribution amounts and would require the program to provide the applicant with an opportunity to demonstrate that, based on reduced family income, the subscriber is subject to a lower premium pursuant to the above-described provisions.The California Children and Families Act of 1998, an initiative measure approved by the voters
		as Proposition 10 at the November 3, 1998, statewide general election, requires that the California Children and Families Program, established by the act, be funded by certain taxes imposed on the sale and distribution of cigarettes and tobacco products, that revenues be deposited into the California Children and Families Trust Fund, and that the fund be used for the implementation of comprehensive early childhood development and smoking prevention programs. Existing law provides that 20% of moneys allocated and appropriated from the trust fund shall be deposited, in accordance with a prescribed formula, in specified accounts, including the Unallocated Account, for expenditure by the California Children and Families Commission, also known as First 5 California, for various subjects relating to, and furthering the goals and purposes of, the act. Existing law prohibits amendment of this initiative measure by the Legislature unless the amendment is approved by the voters, or the amendment is accomplished by a
		vote of 2/3 of the membership of both houses of the Legislature and the amendment furthers the act and is consistent with its purposes.This bill would provide that any funds not needed in specified accounts may be transferred to the Unallocated Account upon approval of the commission. The bill would make a legislative finding and declaration that these changes further the goals and purposes of that act.This bill would require the Director of Finance to make the necessary budgetary adjustments to allow the expenditure of funds allocated by the commission pursuant to the above provisions. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the
		state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.Digest Key

				  court of competent jurisdiction, then those moneys shall be available for expenditure by the state commission for mass media communication emphasizing the need to eliminate smoking and other tobacco use by pregnant women, the need to eliminate smoking and other tobacco use by persons under 18 years of age, and the need to eliminate exposure to secondhand smoke.(H) Any moneys allocated and appropriated to any of the accounts described in subparagraphs (A) to (F), inclusive, that are not encumbered or expended within any applicable period prescribed by law shall (together with the accrued interest on the amount) revert to and remain in the same account for the next fiscal period.(2) Eighty percent shall be allocated and appropriated to county commissions in accordance with Section 130140.(A) The moneys allocated and
				  appropriated to county commissions shall be deposited in each local Children and Families Trust Fund administered by each county commission, and shall be expended only for the purposes authorized by this act and in accordance with the county strategic plan approved by each county commission.(B) Any moneys allocated and appropriated to any of the county commissions that are not encumbered or expended within any applicable period prescribed by law shall (together with the accrued interest on the amount) revert to and remain in the same local Children and Families Trust Fund for the next fiscal period under the same conditions as set forth in subparagraph (A).(e) All grants, gifts, or bequests of money made to or for the benefit of the state commission from public or private sources to be used for early childhood development programs shall be deposited in the California Children
