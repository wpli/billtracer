						LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1009, V. Manuel Perez.
											  Bonds.(1) Existing law establishes in state government the California Debt Limit Allocation Committee, with duties that include annually determining a state ceiling on the aggregate amount of private activity bonds that may be issued, and allocating that amount among state and local agencies. Existing law defines the term “state ceiling” for those purposes with regard to an amount specified in federal law.This bill would revise the definition of “state ceiling” for these purposes to also include certain amounts reserved to the state for qualified energy conservation bonds and recovery zone economic development bonds.(2) Existing law, the California Industrial Development Financing Act, authorizes cities, counties, cities and counties, and redevelopment agencies to establish industrial development authorities that are authorized to issue
		industrial development bonds, the proceeds of which may be used to fund capital projects of private enterprise under terms and conditions specified in the act.This bill would expand the scope of the act by including additional types of projects and costs authorized for financing under the act, including, but not limited to, projects qualified under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. This bill would also authorize financial assistance to businesses for certain costs of a bond issuance.(3) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.Digest Key

The Legislature further finds the alternative method of financing provided in this title will benefit economically distressed communities with concentrated unemployment by employing a labor force from those communities and areas where persons are displaced due to industrial failures. The Legislature further finds that the alternative method of financing provided in this title will benefit economically distressed areas of the state and localities that are making diligent efforts to maintain and provide services to

				  in the public interest and serves a public purpose and will promote the health, welfare, and safety of the citizens of the State of California.The Legislature further finds that regional research and development facilities are beneficial to the state and the regions where they are located by providing jobs, contributing to economic development in the state and the surrounding community, and being a source of intellectual capital and intangible assets that ultimately aid California businesses in entering, expanding, and competing in, world markets.Therefore, the Legislature finds that research and development facilities should be designated “permitted activities” under the state’s industrial development bond program.SEC. 3. Section 91502 of the Government Code is amended to read:91502. It is the purpose of this title to carry out and make effective the findings of the Legislature, and to that end, to provide business with an alternative method of financing in acquiring, constructing, or rehabilitating facilities, including, but not limited to, equipment and furnishings, in accordance with the criteria set forth in Section 91502.1, all to the mutual benefit of the people of the state and to protect their health, welfare, and safety.SEC. 4. Section 91502.1 of the Government Code is amended to read:91502.1. (a) The Legislature declares that it is the policy of this state, consistent with environmental, resource conservation, and other policies, to facilitate for and on behalf of private enterprise the acquisition of property, either suitable for or evidencing an obligation respecting any one or more of the activities or uses set forth in Section 91503, through the issuance of revenue bonds by authorities in accordance with the criteria set forth in subdivision (b), and that this additional method of financing when made available in accordance with that policy serves a public purpose and will promote the prosperity, health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the State of California.(b) The Legislature declares that the criteria to be utilized to determine whether this method of financing may be made available shall include the following:(1) Whether employment benefits arising out of the use of the facilities may ensue by securing or increasing (A) the number of employees of the company and any other direct users of the facilities or (B) compensation for that employment, the value of which may be expressed in terms of aggregate direct employment earnings.(2) Whether energy, mineral or natural or cultivated resource conservation benefits arising out of the use of the facilities may ensue by the reduction of waste, improvement of recovery or intensification of utilization of resources that otherwise would be less intensively utilized, or wasted, or not recovered, the value of which may be expressed in terms of the price and amount of the energy,
				  minerals, or other resources saved or recovered, or the price and amount of equivalent energy, minerals, or other resources that would be utilized were the resources not utilized as intensively.(3) Whether consumer benefits arising out of the use of the facilities may ensue by any of the following:(A) Improvement of the quantity or quality or reduction in the price of products, energy, or related services or facilities, the value of which may be expressed in terms of quantity and price differentials.(B) Production of new or improved products, or related services or facilities, the value of which may be expressed in terms of quantity and price.(C) The transfer of ownership of a business or place of work that has closed or is in danger of closing, to

				  substantially exceed any public detriment from issuance of bonds in the estimated principal amount proposed in the application.(2) Neither the completion of the project nor the operation of the facilities will have the proximate effect of relocation of any substantial operations of the company from one area of the state to another or in the abandonment of any substantial operations of the company within other areas of the state, or, if the completion or operation will have either of the effects, then the completion or operation is reasonably necessary to prevent the relocation of any substantial operations of the company from an area within the state to an area outside the state.(3) The proposed issuance of bonds qualifies for issuance under the provisions of Article 5 (commencing with Section 91570).(c) For those
				  projects qualified under Section 1401 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5), or any amendments thereto, the commission shall review the submission and shall, by express findings on the basis of the submission, determine compliance with criteria contained in that act.(d) Written notification of the determinations of the commission shall be given to the authority.(e) Upon failure of the commission to make determinations as to compliance with the criteria within 60 days of the receipt of the submission, unless the time is extended by written consent of the authority, the commission shall lose jurisdiction to make the determinations, and the authority shall determine compliance with the criteria.(f) A proposed issuance of refunding bonds shall be evaluated solely under the
				  requirement of paragraph (3) of subdivision (b), upon request of the board following the determination provided for in subdivision (j) of Section 91527.(g) Determinations of the commission or of an authority as provided in subdivision (j) of Section 91527, Section 91530, and this section shall be final and conclusive.(h) The authority shall not deliver bonds for the project until this section has been complied with.(i) It is the intention of the Legislature that submissions be reviewed by the commission individually and not comparatively and that determinations be made generally in the order of receipt of the submissions. To the extent consistent with accomplishment of the public purposes as provided in Section 91502, priority consideration shall be given submissions on behalf of small and medium-size companies.
				  To the extent that the public benefits finding under paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section is based on employment benefits under paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of Section 91502.1, the following considerations, as alternatives to each other, may in accordance with the submission, additionally be considered in making such finding:(1) The willingness of the company to provide for the screening for employment of (i) individuals affected by industrial relocations or abandonments, (ii) new entrants or reentrants to the workforce, (iii) unemployed or partially unemployed individuals who are registered for work at a public employment office or other approved place pursuant to Section 1253 of the Unemployment Insurance Code, or (iv) individuals participating in job training or placement programs directly calculated to increase employability or improve the employment of these individuals.(2) The location of the facilities in or conveniently accessible to a portion of the workforce residing within an economically distressed area of the state or an area of the state affected by industrial depression or decline.An adverse finding shall not be made merely because each of such alternative considerations is inapplicable if the facilities are located in or are conveniently accessible to a portion of the workforce residing within a pocket of economic distress or an area of the state largely rural in character.SEC. 10. Section 91533 of the Government Code is amended to read:91533. Authorities shall undertake projects by entry into project agreements in substance not inconsistent with the following:(a) The company shall comply with (or cause to be complied with) all legal requirements relating to the project and the operation, repair, and maintenance of the facilities, including (1) obtaining any rezonings or variances, building, development, and other permits and approvals, and licenses and other entitlements for use, without regard to any exemption for public projects; and (2) securing the issuance of any certificates of need, convenience, and necessity or other certificates or franchises; and shall provide satisfactory evidence of compliance.(b) The company shall comply with all conditions imposed by the public agency in its approval of the project pursuant to subdivision (f) of Section 91530.(c) The company shall provide, or cause to be provided by others, all amounts required for the project and all property relating to the project that are not to be provided as or by expenditure of bond proceeds, and in the case of any amounts and property that the company proposes to cause to be provided by others, as by contract, grant, subsidy, loan, or other form of assistance, shall provide satisfactory evidence that those amounts and property will be provided when required.(d) Expenditure of bond proceeds shall be supervised to assure proper application to the project.(e) The company shall at its
				  own expense insure, repair, and maintain the facilities, pay taxes with respect to its interests in the property relating to the project as Division 1 (commencing with Section 101) of the Revenue and Taxation Code requires, and pay assessments and other public charges secured by liens, upon those interests as constitute the tax base for property taxation on the same basis as other property, or shall cause the same to be provided by others to the satisfaction of the authority.(f) The amounts payable pursuant to the project agreements to or for the benefit of an authority shall in the aggregate not be less than amounts sufficient (1) to pay any bonds that shall be issued by the authority to pay the cost of the project, (2) to maintain any required reserves, (3) to make payments as may be required into any sinking fund or other similar fund, and (4) to pay those administration expenses that relate to the administration of the project agreements,
