						LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1465, Hill.
											  Urban water management planning.Existing law requires every urban water supplier to prepare and adopt an urban water management plan, in accordance with specified requirements, for submission to the Department of Water Resources and other entities. An urban water supplier is required to provide information relating to the supplier’s water demand management measures.Existing law allows urban water suppliers that are members of the California Urban Water Conservation Council and submit annual reports to that council to satisfy this requirement by submitting those reports to the department.This bill would deem water suppliers that are members of the council and comply with the “Memorandum of Understanding Regarding Urban Water Conservation in California,” dated December 10, 2008, as it may be amended, to be in compliance with the requirement to describe the supplier’s water demand management measures in its urban water management plan.Digest Key

The projected population estimates shall be based upon data from the state, regional, or local service agency population projections within the service area of the urban water supplier and shall be in five-year increments to 20 years or as far as data is available.(b) Identify and quantify, to the extent practicable, the existing
				  and planned sources of water available to the supplier over the same five-year increments described in subdivision (a). If groundwater is identified as an existing or planned source of water available to the supplier, all of the following information shall be included in the plan:(1) A copy of any groundwater management plan adopted by the urban water supplier, including plans adopted pursuant to Part 2.75 (commencing with Section 10750), or any other specific authorization for groundwater management.(2) A description of any groundwater basin or basins from which the urban water supplier pumps groundwater. For those basins for which a court or the board has adjudicated the rights to pump groundwater, a copy of the order or decree adopted by the court or the board and a description of the amount of groundwater the urban water supplier has the legal right to pump under the order or decree. For basins that have not been adjudicated, information as to
				  whether the department has identified the basin or basins as overdrafted or has projected that the basin will become overdrafted if present management conditions continue, in the most current official departmental bulletin that characterizes the condition of the groundwater basin, and a detailed description of the efforts being undertaken by the urban water supplier to eliminate the long-term overdraft condition.(3) A detailed description and analysis of the location, amount, and sufficiency of groundwater pumped by the urban water supplier for the past five years. The description and analysis shall be based on information that is reasonably available, including, but not limited to, historic use records.(4) A detailed description and analysis of the amount and location of groundwater that is projected to be pumped by the urban water supplier. The description and analysis shall be based on information that is reasonably available, including, but not
				  limited to, historic use records.(c) (1) Describe the reliability of the water supply and vulnerability to seasonal or climatic shortage, to the extent practicable, and provide data for each of the following:(A) An average water year.(B) A single dry water year.(C) Multiple dry water years.(2) For any water source that may not be available at a consistent level of use, given specific legal, environmental, water quality, or climatic factors, describe plans to supplement or replace that source with alternative sources or water demand management measures, to the extent practicable.(d) Describe the opportunities for exchanges or transfers of water on a short-term or long-term basis.(e) (1) Quantify, to the extent records are available, past and current water use, over
				  the same five-year increments described in subdivision (a), and projected water use, identifying the uses among water use sectors, including, but not necessarily limited to, all of the following uses:(A) Single-family residential.(B) Multifamily.(C) Commercial.(D) Industrial.(E) Institutional and governmental.(F) Landscape.(G) Sales to other agencies.(H) Saline water intrusion barriers, groundwater recharge, or conjunctive use, or any combination thereof.(I) Agricultural.(2) The water use projections shall be in the same five-year increments described in subdivision (a).(f) Provide a description of the supplier’s water demand management measures. This description shall include all of the
				  following:(1) A description of each water demand management measure that is currently being implemented, or scheduled for implementation, including the steps necessary to implement any proposed measures, including, but not limited to, all of the following:(A) Water survey programs for single-family residential and multifamily residential customers.(B) Residential plumbing retrofit.(C) System water audits, leak detection, and repair.(D) Metering with commodity rates for all new connections and retrofit of existing connections.(E) Large landscape conservation programs and incentives.(F) High-efficiency washing machine rebate programs.(G) Public information programs.(H) School education programs.(I) Conservation programs for
				  commercial, industrial, and institutional accounts.(J) Wholesale agency programs.(K) Conservation pricing.(L) Water conservation coordinator.(M) Water waste prohibition.(N) Residential ultra-low-flush toilet replacement programs.(2) A schedule of implementation for all water demand management measures proposed or described in the plan.(3) A description of the methods, if any, that the supplier will use to evaluate the effectiveness of water demand management measures implemented or described under the plan.(4) An estimate, if available, of existing conservation savings on water use within the supplier’s service area, and the effect of the savings on the supplier’s ability to further reduce demand.(g) An evaluation of each water demand management
				  measure listed in paragraph (1) of subdivision (f) that is not currently being implemented or scheduled for implementation. In the course of the evaluation, first consideration shall be given to water demand management measures, or combination of measures, that offer lower incremental costs than expanded or additional water supplies. This evaluation shall do all of the following:(1) Take into account economic and noneconomic factors, including environmental, social, health, customer impact, and technological factors.(2) Include a cost-benefit analysis, identifying total benefits and total costs.(3) Include a description of funding available to implement any planned water supply project that would provide water at a higher unit cost.(4) Include a description of the water supplier’s legal authority to implement the measure and efforts to work with other relevant agencies to ensure the
				  implementation of the measure and to share the cost of implementation.(h) Include a description of all water supply projects and water supply programs that may be undertaken by the urban water supplier to meet the total projected water use as established pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 10635. The urban water supplier shall include a detailed description of expected future projects and programs, other than the demand management programs identified pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (f), that the urban water supplier may implement to increase the amount of the water supply available to the urban water supplier in average, single-dry, and multiple-dry water years.
