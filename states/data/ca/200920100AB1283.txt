						SmythFebruary 27, 2009 An act to amend Section 30330 of the Public Resources Code, relating to coastal resources. An act to add Section 316 to the Public Utilities Code, relating to electricity.LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1283, as amended, Smyth.
											  California Coastal Commission. Public Utilities Commission: review of pending legislation.Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including electrical corporations. Existing law requires the commission to prepare and submit to the Governor and the Legislature a written report annually before February 1 of each year on the costs of programs and activities conducted by an electrical corporation or gas corporation that has more than a specified number of customers in California.This bill would require the commission to advise the Legislature whenever it comes to the attention of the commission that a bill that is pending before the Legislature would likely (1) reduce the reliability of the electrical transmission and distribution system in any area of the state, (2) result in a shortage of electricity needed to meet projected demand in any area of the state, (3) impair the
		ability of retail sellers or local publicly owned electric utilities to meet their renewables portfolio standard, or (4) impair the ability of any electrical corporation, local publicly owned electric utility, electric service provider, or community choice aggregator to meet its emission reduction goals pursuant to the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006. The bill would require the commission to advise the Governor whenever it comes to the attention of the commission that an enrolled bill would likely have any of these 4 effects. The bill would require the commission to consult with the Energy Commission when advising the Legislature or Governor on any of the 4 effects and to consult with the Independent System Operation when advising the Legislature or Governor with respect to likely effects (1) or (2).Under existing law, the California Coastal Commission has the primary responsibility for the implementation of the provisions of the California Coastal Act, unless otherwise specified, and is designated as the state coastal zone planning and management agency for any and all purposes, and is authorized to exercise any and all powers set forth in the Federal Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 or any amendment thereto or any other federal act heretofore or hereafter enacted that relates to the planning or management of the coastal zone.This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to these provisions.Digest Key
