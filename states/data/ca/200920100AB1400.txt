						FongFebruary 27, 2009 An act to add Section 76038 to the Education Code, relating to community college districts. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1400, Fong.
											  Community colleges: expulsion: hearing.(1) Existing law establishes the California Community Colleges, under the administration of the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, as one of the segments of public postsecondary education in this state. Existing law establishes community college districts, administered by a governing board, throughout the state, and authorizes these districts to provide instruction to students at the community college campuses maintained by the districts.Existing law authorizes the governing board of a district to expel a student for good cause when the presence of the student causes a continuing danger to the physical safety of the student or others. Existing law requires that the expulsion be accompanied by a hearing.This bill would authorize the governing board of a district to either deny enrollment, permit enrollment, or permit conditional
		enrollment to any individual who has been expelled from a community college within the preceding 10 years, or who is, at the time of the application, undergoing expulsion procedures, for certain offenses, as provided, if the board determines that the person continues to pose a risk to the safety of others. This bill would authorize the board to hold a hearing before making the determination as to whether the person continues to pose a risk. The bill would authorize a governing board of a district to delegate its authority under these provisions to the superintendent or president of the district, or to his or her designee.The bill would expressly apply specified immunities to an exercise of discretion by a community college district, and its officers and employees, under these provisions.The bill would also allow the community college district to request information from another community college district in determining
		whether the applicant continues to pose a danger to the physical safety of others. The bill would require any community college district receiving the request to respond to the request within 5 working days.By requiring a community college district to respond to the request of another community college for information regarding an expelled student, this bill would create a state-mandated local program.(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.Digest Key
