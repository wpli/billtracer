						HallFebruary 27, 2009An act to amend Section 2893 of the Public Utilities Code, relating to telecommunications. An act to amend Section 1807 of the Public Utilities Code, relating to public utilities.LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1497, as amended, Hall.
											  Telephone call identification service. Public utilities: intervenor fees.Existing law provides compensation for reasonable advocate’s fees, reasonable expert witness fees, and other reasonable costs to public utility customers of participation or intervention in any proceeding of the Public Utilities Commission. Any award for that compensation shall be paid by the public utility that is the subject of the hearing, investigation, or proceeding. Existing law provides that an award shall be allowed by the commission as an expense for the purpose of establishing rates of the public utility. An existing decision of the commission establishes the intervenor compensation program fund for quasi-legislative or rulemaking proceedings funded through commission reimbursement fees collected on an annual basis from electrical, gas, telephone, and water corporations.This bill would require an award related to a telephone
		corporation that is not regulated under a rate-of-return regulatory framework to be paid from the commission’s intervenor compensation program fund. Existing law, with specified exceptions, requires the Public Utilities Commission to require any call identification service offered by a telephone corporation, or by any other person or corporation that makes use of the facilities of a telephone corporation, to allow the caller, at no charge, to withhold, on an individual basis, the display of the caller’s telephone number from the telephone instrument of the individual receiving the call, but prohibits a caller from withholding the display of the caller’s business telephone number when that number is being used for telemarketing purposes. Existing law requires that a telephone corporation notify its subscribers that their calls may be identified to a called party either (1) 30 or more days before the telephone corporation commences to participate in the offering of a call identification service, or (2) by March 1, 1990, if the telephone corporation is participating in a call identification service prior to
		January 1, 1990.This bill would delete the requirement that a telephone corporation that is participating in a call identification service prior to January 1, 1990, notify subscribers by March 1, 1990, that their calls may be identified to a called party.Digest Key
