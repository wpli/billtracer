											  Charter revocation schools.The Charter Schools Act of 1992 authorizes a charter school to establish a resource center, meeting space, or other satellite facility located in a county adjacent to that in which the charter school is authorized if the specified conditions are met, including that the facility is used exclusively for the educational support of pupils who are enrolled in nonclassroom-based independent study of the charter school.This bill, in addition, would authorize a charter school to establish one or more resource centers, meeting spaces, or other satellite facilities located in the county in which the charter school is authorized if each of the facilities is used exclusively for the educational support of pupils who are enrolled in nonclassroom-based independent study of the charter school.Existing law authorizes the State Board of Education, whether or not it is the chartering authority, to take appropriate action based upon the recommendation of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, including, but not limited to, revocation of the school’s charter when the state board finds that the school has committed one of several specified misdeeds.This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to that provision.Digest Key
