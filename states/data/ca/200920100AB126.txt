											  Department of Forestry and Fire Protection: employment: criminal background checks.Existing law requires the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection to be responsible for the fire protection, fire prevention, maintenance, and enhancement of the state’s forest, range, and brushland resources, contract fire protection, associated emergency services, and assistance in civil disasters and other nonfire emergencies.This bill would require the department to conduct a state and federal level criminal offender record information search through the Department of Justice prior to hiring an applicant for a position with the department or the State Board of Forestry and Fire Protection, with exceptions. The bill would require the Department of Justice to provide the information electronically, and require the department to request the Department of Justice to provide subsequent arrest notification services. The applicant would pay the fee charged by the Department of Justice for processing the request, and the
		department would refund the fee once that person had been employed 24 months cumulatively.This bill would require the department to make and enforce those regulations necessary and proper for the implementation and maintenance of the requirements of these provisions.Digest Key
