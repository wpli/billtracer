Cities, counties, districts, and nonprofit organizations would be authorized to receive the grants. The bill would require the department to develop criteria for the review and
		approval of grant applications, that may include the establishment of cost sharing cost-sharing requirements and appropriate oversight and reporting requirements.This bill would require that an eligible community meet certain specified criteria and put limitations on the size of trees that could be removed and prohibit those trees from being made into logs of lumber.

		and that the department report to the Legislature yearly, and post the report on its Internet Web site.Digest Key
