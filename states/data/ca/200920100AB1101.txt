						DuvallFebruary 27, 2009 An act to amend Section 1050 1605 of the Fish and Game Code, relating to the Department of Fish and Game. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1101, as amended, Duvall.
											  Department of Fish and Game: licenses and other entitlements. Department of Fish and Game: lake and streambed alteration agreements.Existing law prohibits a person, state or local governmental agency, or a public utility, from substantially diverting or obstructing the natural flow of, or substantially changing or using any material from the bed, channel, or bank of, any river, stream, or lake, or depositing or disposing of debris, waste, or other material containing crumbled, flaked, or ground pavement where it may pass into any river, stream, or lake, unless prescribed requirements are met, including written notification to the Department of Fish and Game regarding the activity. Existing law requires the department to determine whether the activity may substantially adversely affect an existing fish and wildlife resource and, if so, to provide a draft lake or streambed alteration agreement to the person, agency, or utility.Existing law prescribes various requirements for
		lake and streambed alteration agreements and generally prohibits the term of an agreement from exceeding 5 years. Existing law authorizes the department to issue an agreement for a term of longer than 5 years if prescribed conditions are satisfied and prohibits the department from extending an agreement for more than 5 years. Existing law authorizes time periods related to lake and streambed alteration agreements to be extended by mutual agreement.This bill would additionally provide for the issuance of a lake or streambed alteration agreement for a term longer than 5 years, and the extension of the term of a lake or streambed alteration agreement for more than 5 years, by mutual agreement.Existing law requires that all licenses, permits, tags, reservations, and other entitlements authorized by the Fish and Game Code be prepared and issued by the Department of Fish and Game.This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to that provision.Digest Key

                                NO  Bill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. Section 1605 of the Fish and Game Code is amended to read:1605. (a) (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the term of an agreement shall not exceed five years.(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), after the agreement expires, the entity shall remain responsible for implementing any mitigation or other measures specified in the agreement to protect fish and wildlife resources.(b) Any entity may request one extension of a previously-approved agreement, if the entity requests the extension prior to the expiration of its original term. The department shall grant the extension unless it determines that the agreement requires modification because the measures contained in the agreement no longer protect the fish and wildlife resources that the activity may substantially adversely affect.  In the event
				  If the department makes that determination, the department shall propose measures intended to protect those resources.(c) If the entity disagrees with the department’s determination that the agreement requires modification to protect fish and wildlife resources, or with the measures proposed by the department, the disagreement shall be resolved pursuant to the procedures described in subdivision (b) of Section 1603.(d) The department may shall not extend an agreement for more than five years, except by mutual agreement pursuant to
				  Section 1607.(e) (1) An original agreement shall remain in effect until the department grants the extension request, or new measures are imposed to protect fish and wildlife resources by agreement or through the arbitration process.(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an original agreement may shall not remain in effect for more than one year after its expiration date.(f) If the entity fails to submit a request to extend an agreement prior to its expiration, the entity shall submit a new notification before commencing or continuing the activity covered by the agreement.(g) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of subdivision (a), the department may issue an agreement,
				  that otherwise meets the requirements of this chapter, for a term longer than five years either by mutual agreement pursuant to Section 1607 or if the following conditions are satisfied:(1) The information the entity provides to the department in its notification meets the requirements of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 1602.(2) The entity agrees to provide a status report to the department every four years. The status report shall be delivered to the department no later than 90 days prior to the end of each four-year period, and shall include all of the following information:(A) A copy of the original agreement.(B) The status of the activity covered by the agreement.(C) An evaluation of the success or failure of the measures in the agreement to
				  protect the fish and wildlife resources that the activity may substantially adversely affect.(D) A discussion of any factors that could increase the predicted adverse impacts on fish and wildlife resources, and a description of the resources that may be adversely affected.(3) The department shall review the four-year status report, and conduct an onsite inspection to confirm that the entity is in compliance with the agreement and that the measures in the agreement continue to protect the fish and wildlife resources. If the department determines that the measures in the agreement no longer protect the fish and wildlife resources that are being substantially adversely affected by the activity, the department, in consultation with the entity, and within 45 days of receipt of the report, shall impose one or more new measures to protect the fish and wildlife resources affected by the activity. If requested to do so by the entity, the department shall make
				  available the information upon which it determined the agreement no longer protects the affected fish and wildlife resources. If the entity disagrees with one or more of the new measures, within seven days of receiving the new measures, it shall notify the department, in writing, of the disagreement. The entity and the department shall consult regarding the disagreement. The consultation shall be completed within seven days after the department receives the entity’s notice of disagreement. If the department and entity fail to reach agreement, the entity may request, in writing, the appointment of a panel of arbitrators to resolve the disagreement. The panel of arbitrators shall be appointed within 14 days of the completed consultation. The panel of arbitrators shall issue a decision within 14 days of the date it is established. All other provisions of subdivision (b) of Section 1603 regarding the panel shall apply to any arbitration panel established in accordance with this subdivision
				  paragraph. If the entity fails to provide timely status reports as required by this subdivision, the department may suspend or revoke the agreement.(4) The agreement shall authorize department employees to conduct onsite inspections relevant to the agreement, upon reasonable notice. Nothing in this section limits the authority of department employees to inspect private or public sites.(5) Except as provided in paragraph (3), subparagraph (D) of paragraph (4) of subdivision (a) of Section 1602 and the time periods to process agreements specified in this chapter do not apply to agreements issued pursuant to this section.(h) Each region of the department shall log the notifications of activities for which a long-term agreement is being considered pursuant to subdivision (g). The log shall list the date the notification was received by the department, a brief description of the proposed
				  activity, and the location of the activity. Each item shall remain on the log for one year. Upon written request by any person, a regional office shall send the log to that person monthly for one year. A request made pursuant to this paragraph subdivision may be renewed annually.SECTION 1.Section 1050 of the Fish and Game Code is amended to read:1050.(a)All licenses, permits, tags, reservations, and other entitlements authorized by this code shall be prepared and issued by the department.(b)The commission shall determine the form of all licenses, permits, tags, reservations, and other entitlements and the method of carrying and displaying all licenses, and may require and prescribe the form of applications therefor and the form of any contrivance to be used in connection therewith.(c)Whenever any provision of this code provides for a license, permit,

				  reservation, or other entitlement, the commission may establish a nonrefundable application fee, not to exceed seven dollars and fifty cents ($7.50), that is sufficient to pay the department’s costs for issuing the license, permit, tag, reservation, or other entitlement and may adjust the application fee in accordance with Section 713.
