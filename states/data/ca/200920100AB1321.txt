											  Environment: The Advance Infrastructure Mitigation Program Act.(1)TheThe California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires a lead agency to prepare, or cause to be prepared, and certify the completion of, an environmental impact report on a project, as defined, that it proposes to carry out or approve that may have a significant effect on the environment, as defined, or to adopt a negative declaration if it finds that the project will not have that effect. This bill would enact the Advance Infrastructure Mitigation Program Act, which would establish the Advance Infrastructure Mitigation Program, including defining terms for that purpose. The bill would authorize the
		Natural Resources Agency to administer and implement the program by taking specified
		certain actions. Those actions would include preparing, approving, and implementing regional advance mitigation plans, the contents of which the bill would specify, for planned infrastructure projects, as defined, identified by an infrastructure planning agency, as defined. The bill would specify that the purpose of a regional advance mitigation plan is to provide effective mitigation and conservation of natural resources and natural processes on a landscape, regional, or statewide scale, to expedite the environmental review of planned infrastructure projects, and to facilitate the implementation of measures to mitigate the impacts of those projects by identifying and implementing mitigation measures in advance of project approval. The bill also would authorize the agency to acquire, restore, manage, monitor, and preserve lands, waterways, aquatic resources, or fisheries,
		or fund those actions, in accordance with an approved regional advance mitigation plan or as otherwise specified, and to establish or fund the establishment of mitigation banks and conservation banks and purchase credits at those types of banks as specified. The bill would authorize the agency to take other specified actions with respect to mitigation credits or values created or acquired under the program. The bill would authorize an infrastructure planning agency to identify planned infrastructure projects for the purposes of including the projects in a regional advance mitigation plan or for other advance mitigation under the program, and would authorize the agency to enter a memorandum of understanding or other agreement with an infrastructure planning agency for specified purposes of the
		program. The bill would establish the Advance Infrastructure Mitigation Fund in the State Treasury. Upon appropriation by the Legislature, the bill would require moneys in the fund to be used by the agency to administer and implement the program.The bill would specify that the program is intended to improve the efficiency and efficacy of mitigation only and is not intended to supplant the requirements of CEQA or any other environmental law.

								CHAPTER
							 1. General21200. This division shall be known, and may be cited, as the Advance Infrastructure Mitigation Program Act.21201. (a) The purpose of this division is to improve the success and effectiveness of actions implemented to mitigate the natural resource impacts of future infrastructure projects by establishing the means to implement those actions well before the infrastructure projects are constructed. The advance identification and implementation of mitigation actions also will streamline the delivery of infrastructure projects by anticipating mitigation requirements for planned infrastructure projects and avoiding or reducing delays associated with environmental permitting. By identifying regional or statewide conservation priorities and by anticipating the impacts of planned infrastructure projects on a regional or statewide basis, mitigation actions can be designed to protect and restore California’s most valuable
						natural resources and also facilitate environmental compliance for planned infrastructure projects on a regional scale.(b) This division is not intended to create a new environmental permitting or regulatory program or to modify existing environmental laws or regulations, nor is it intended to address all mitigation that may be required for planned infrastructure projects. Instead, it is intended to provide a way in which to anticipate and fulfill the requirements of existing state and federal environmental laws that protect fish, wildlife, plant species, and other natural resources more efficiently and effectively.21202. The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:(a) The minimization and mitigation of environmental impacts is ordinarily handled on a project-by-project basis, usually at the end of a project’s timeline and without guidance regarding regional or statewide conservation priorities.(b) The cost of critical transportation, flood control, and other infrastructure projects often escalates because of permitting delays that occur when appropriate conservation and mitigation measures cannot easily be identified and because the cost of these measures often increases between the time a project is planned and funded and the time mitigation is implemented.(c) Addressing biological conservation and mitigation needs early in a project’s timeline, during project design and development, can reduce costs and allow natural resources conservation to be integrated with project siting and design.(d) When the Department of Transportation, the Department of Water Resources, and other public agencies are able to anticipate the mitigation needs for planned infrastructure projects, they can meet those needs in a more timely and cost-effective way, by using long-range regional advance mitigation planning.(e) Working with state and federal resource protection agencies, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Water Resources, and other public agencies could identify, conserve, and, where appropriate, restore lands for mitigation of numerous projects early in the projects’
						timelines, thereby allowing public funds to stretch further by acquiring habitat at a lower cost and avoiding environmental permitting delays.(f) Regional advance mitigation planning can provide an effective means of facilitating delivery of state and federal economic stimulus funding to infrastructure projects while ensuring more effective natural resource and wildlife conservation.(g) Regional advance mitigation planning is needed to direct mitigation funding for transportation, flood control, and energy projects to agreed upon agreed-upon conservation priorities and to the creation of habitat reserves and recreation areas that enhance the sustainability of human and natural systems by
						protecting or restoring connectivity of natural communities and the delivery of ecosystem services.(h) Regional advance mitigation planning can facilitate the implementation of climate change adaptation strategies both for ecosystems and California’s economy.(i) Regional advance mitigation planning can enable the state to protect, restore, and recover its natural capital as it strengthens and improves its infrastructure.21203. The Legislature intends to do all of the following by enacting this division:(a) Facilitate delivery of infrastructure projects while ensuring more effective natural resource and wildlife conservation.(b) Develop effective strategies to improve the state’s ability to meet mounting demands for transportation, flood control, and energy services, and to maximize conservation and other public benefits.(c) Achieve conservation objectives of statewide and regional importance by coordinating local, state, and federal
						federally funded natural resource conservation efforts with mitigation actions required for impacts from public infrastructure projects.(d) Create administrative, governance, and financial incentives and mechanisms necessary to ensure that measures required to minimize or mitigate impacts from infrastructure projects will serve to achieve regional or statewide natural resource conservation objectives.
								CHAPTER
							 2. Definitions21204. For the purposes of this division, the following terms have the following meanings:(a) “Acquire” and “acquisition” mean, with respect to land or a waterway, acquisition of fee title or purchase of a conservation easement, that protects conservation and mitigation values on the land or waterway in perpetuity.(b) “Agency” means the Natural Resources Agency.(c) “Infrastructure planning agency” means the Department of
						Transportation, the Department of Water Resources, a metropolitan planning organization, a regional transportation planning agency, or other public agency that implements infrastructure projects.(d) “Infrastructure project” means the construction, repair, or modification of a transportation, flood control, energy, or water facility.(e) “Planned infrastructure project” means a project that the Department of Transportation, the Department of Water Resources, or other public agency has concluded is reasonably likely to be constructed within 20 years and that has been identified to the agency for purposes of this division. A planned infrastructure project may include, but is not limited to, projects that have been proposed for approval or approved.(f) “Program” means the Advance Infrastructure Mitigation Program
						implemented pursuant to this division.(g) “Regional advance mitigation plan” means a regional or statewide plan developed in accordance with this division that estimates the potential future compensatory mitigation requirements for one or more planned infrastructure projects and identifies mitigation projects, sites, or credits that would fulfill some or all of those requirements.(h) “Regulatory agency” means a state and or federal natural resource protection agency with regulatory authority over planned infrastructure projects. A regulatory agency includes, but is not limited to, the Department of Fish and Game, California regional water quality control boards, the United States Fish and
						Wildlife Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, and the United States Army Corps of Engineers.
								CHAPTER
							 3. Advance Infrastructure Mitigation Program21205. This division establishes the Advance Infrastructure Mitigation Program to fulfill the purposes of this division. The agency may do any of the following to administer and implement the program:(a) Prepare, approve, and implement regional advance mitigation plans for one or more planned infrastructure projects identified pursuant to Section 21207. The purpose of a regional advance mitigation plan is to provide effective mitigation and conservation of natural resources and natural processes on a landscape, regional, or statewide scale, to expedite the environmental review of planned infrastructure projects, and to facilitate the implementation of measures to mitigate the impacts of those projects by identifying and implementing mitigation measures in advance of
						project approval.(b) Acquire, restore, manage, monitor, and preserve lands, waterways, aquatic resources, or fisheries, or fund the acquisition, restoration, management, monitoring, and preservation of lands, waterways, aquatic resources, or fisheries, in accordance with a regional advance mitigation plan approved by the agency pursuant to this division.(c) Acquire, restore, manage, monitor, and preserve lands, waterways, aquatic resources, or fisheries, or fund the acquisition, restoration, management, monitoring, and preservation of lands,
						waterways, aquatic resources, or fisheries, outside of an approved regional advance mitigation plan if the agency determines that those actions would conserve or create biological values that are appropriate to mitigate the estimated impacts of one or more planned infrastructure projects identified pursuant to Section 21207.(d) Establish mitigation banks or conservation banks, or fund the establishment of mitigation banks or conservation banks, in accordance with applicable state and federal standards. The agency also may purchase credits at mitigation banks and conservation banks if the agency determines that the credits provide biologically appropriate mitigation for one or more planned infrastructure projects identified pursuant to Section 21207.(e) Establish the type and quantity of mitigation credits or values created under the program by obtaining
						the approval of those credits or values from relevant regulatory agencies. This division is not intended to supplant or abrogate the authority of a regulatory agency to determine mitigation requirements under state or federal environmental laws or to determine the type or quantity of mitigation credits or values that may be used to fulfill those requirements.(f) Use, or allow infrastructure planning agencies to use, mitigation credits or values created or acquired under the program to fulfill the mitigation requirements of planned infrastructure projects if the infrastructure planning agency reimburses the program for all costs of creating the mitigation credits or values, as determined by the agency.21206. A regional advance mitigation plan shall do all of the following:(a) Use geographic information system analysis, field surveys, and principles of conservation planning to estimate the nature and extent of mitigation requirements of identified planned infrastructure projects on a regional or statewide basis.(b) Propose measures to avoid or minimize the adverse environmental impacts of planned infrastructure projects, including, where appropriate, the identification of project alignments and design features that would avoid or minimize those impacts.(c) Anticipate and provide for
						compensatory mitigation for planned infrastructure projects’ impacts on natural resources and natural processes by identifying needed mitigation and, to the extent practicable, identifying suitable mitigation lands or waterways.(d) Identify and provide for the preservation of wildlife movement corridors and habitat connectivity to avoid ecological fragmentation and to enable ecosystem adaptation to climate change.(e) Consider impacts on water quality and riparian habitat, rare plant species, sensitive species, fisheries, and declining natural communities including oak woodlands, vernal pools, native grasslands, and
						serpentine habitat.(f) Identify the amount of greenhouse gas reductions estimated to be achieved through the regional advance mitigation plan.(g) Provide for endowments to manage and monitor acquired or protected lands, waterways, or fisheries, as necessary.(h) Where available and biologically appropriate, provide for the purchase of mitigation credits at mitigation banks or conservation banks or for the payment of mitigation fees within established mitigation programs.(i) Analyze the cost effectiveness
						cost-effectiveness of available mitigation alternatives both in terms of environmental benefits and improved project delivery and certainty.(j) Include measurable performance objectives and a monitoring and evaluation program. 21207. (a) An infrastructure planning agency may identify planned infrastructure projects for the purpose of including those projects in a regional advance mitigation plan or for other advance mitigation under the program. The infrastructure planning agency shall provide an analysis and estimate of the projects’ direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts. The analysis and estimate shall include all available relevant information regarding those impacts and the analysis shall be at a level of detail commensurate with the available relevant information. Detailed analysis shall not be required where relevant detailed information about the projects’ impacts is not available.(b) The agency may enter a memorandum of understanding or
						other agreement with an infrastructure planning agency to do all of the following:(1) Specify terms consistent with this division under which the program will provide advance mitigation for the identified planned infrastructure projects.(2) Establish guidelines for communication and sharing of relevant information necessary to optimize coordination and collaboration between the agency and the infrastructure planning agency.(3) Establish guidelines for strategically locating mitigation and conservation sites to maximize the biological benefit and conservation value to target species, habitats, and aquatic resources. 21208. The Advance Infrastructure Mitigation Fund is established in the State Treasury. Upon appropriation by the Legislature, all moneys in the fund shall be used by the agency to administer and implement the program. All moneys provided by infrastructure planning agencies to reimburse program expenditures pursuant to subdivision (f) of Section 21205 shall be deposited in the fund. 21209. The program is intended to improve the efficiency and efficacy of mitigation only and is not intended to supplant the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000)) or any other environmental law. The identification of planned infrastructure projects and the identification of mitigation projects or measures for planned infrastructure projects under this division does not imply or require approval of those projects for purposes of the California Environmental Quality Act (Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000)) or any other environmental law.
