						Skinner, MaFebruary 27, 2009 An act to amend Sections 12920, 12921, 12926, 12940, 12945.2, and 12955.2 of the Government Code, relating to employment. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1001, as amended, Skinner.
											  Employment: familial status protection.Existing law, the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, protects and safeguards the right and opportunity of all persons to seek, obtain, and hold employment without discrimination or abridgment on account of race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, marital status, sex, age, or sexual orientation.This bill would include “familial status” as an additional basis upon which the right to seek, obtain, and hold employment cannot be denied. The bill would, for employment purposes, define “familial status” as having or providing care for a child, domestic partner, grandchild, grandparent, parent, parent-in-law, sibling, or spouse. Existing law, the California Family Rights Act, permits employees of specified employers with more than 12 months of service with the employer and who have at least 1,250 hours of service with the employer during the previous 12-month period of employment to take up to a total of 12 workweeks in any 12-month
			 period for family care and medical leave. Existing law defines “family care and medical leave” to mean leave for the birth or adoption of a child, the serious health condition of a child, parent, or spouse, or the serious health condition of the employee.This bill would expand the definition of “family care and medical leave” to mean leave for the birth or adoption of a child, to care for the serious health condition of a parent, a grandparent, a parent-in-law, a spouse, a domestic partner, a sibling, or a child, or the serious health condition of the employee. The bill would also provide nonexclusive examples of activities that constitute care for the serious health condition of another.Digest Key

                                NO  Bill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. Section 12920 of the Government Code is amended to read:12920. It is hereby declared as the public policy of this state that it is necessary to protect and safeguard the right and opportunity of all persons to seek, obtain, and hold employment without discrimination or abridgment on account of race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, marital status, familial status, sex, age, or sexual orientation.It is recognized that the practice of denying employment opportunity and discriminating in the terms of employment for these reasons foments domestic strife and unrest, deprives the state of the fullest utilization of its capacities for development and advancement, and substantially and adversely affects the interest of employees, employers, and the public in
				  general.Further, the practice of discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, marital status, national origin, ancestry, familial status, disability, or sexual orientation in housing accommodations is declared to be against public policy.It is the purpose of this part to provide effective remedies that will eliminate these discriminatory practices.This part shall be deemed an exercise of the police power of the state for the protection of the welfare, health, and peace of the people of this state.SEC. 2. Section 12921 of the Government Code is amended to read:12921. (a) The opportunity to seek, obtain and hold employment without discrimination because of race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, marital status, familial status, sex, age, or sexual orientation is hereby recognized as and declared to be a civil right.(b) The opportunity to seek, obtain, and hold housing without discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, national origin, ancestry, familial status, disability, or any other basis prohibited by Section 51 of the Civil Code is hereby recognized as and declared to be a civil right.SEC. 3. Section 12926 of the Government Code is amended to read:12926. As used in this part in connection with unlawful practices, unless a different meaning clearly appears from the context:(a) “Affirmative relief” or “prospective relief” includes the authority to order reinstatement of an employee, an award of backpay, reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses, hiring, transfer, reassignment, a grant of tenure, promotion, a cease and desist order, posting of a notice, training of personnel, testing, expunging of records, reporting of records, and any other similar relief that is intended to correct an unlawful practice under this part.(b) “Age” refers to the chronological age of an individual who has reached his or her 40th birthday.(c) “Employee” does not include an individual employed by his or her parents, spouse, or child, or an individual employed under a special license in a nonprofit sheltered workshop or rehabilitation facility.(d) “Employer” includes a person regularly employing five or more persons, or a person acting as an agent of an employer, directly or indirectly, the state or a political or civil subdivision of the state, and cities, except as follows:“Employer” does not include a religious association or corporation not organized for private profit.(e) “Employment agency” includes a person undertaking for compensation to procure employees or opportunities to work.(f) “Essential functions” means the fundamental job duties

				  school, college, university, or trade school do not, in and of themselves, constitute unlawful employment practices.(b) For a labor organization, because of the race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, marital status, familial status, sex, age, or sexual orientation of a person, to exclude, expel, or restrict from its membership the person, or to provide only second-class or segregated membership or to discriminate against a person because of the race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, marital status, familial status, sex, age, or sexual orientation of the person in the election of officers of the labor organization or in the selection of the labor organization’s staff or to discriminate in any way against its members or against an employer or against a person employed by an employer.(c) For a person to discriminate against a person in the selection or training of that person in an apprenticeship training program or any other training program leading to employment because of the race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, marital status, familial status, sex, age, or sexual orientation of the person discriminated against.(d) For an employer or employment agency to print or circulate or cause to be printed or circulated a publication, or to make a non-job-related inquiry of an employee or applicant, either verbal or through use of an application form, that expresses, directly or indirectly, a limitation, specification, or discrimination as to race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, marital status, familial status,

				  facility.(h) For an employer, labor organization, employment agency, or person to discharge, expel, or otherwise discriminate against a person because the person has opposed a practice forbidden under this part or because the person has filed a complaint, testified, or assisted in a proceeding under this part.(i) For a person to aid, abet, incite, compel, or coerce the doing of an act forbidden under this part, or to attempt to do so.(j) (1) For an employer, labor organization, employment agency, apprenticeship training program or a training program leading to employment, or any other person, because of race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, marital status, familial status, sex, age, or sexual orientation, to harass
				  an employee, an applicant, or a person providing services pursuant to a contract. Harassment of an employee, an applicant, or a person providing services pursuant to a contract by an employee, other than an agent or supervisor, shall be unlawful if the entity, or an agent or supervisor of the entity, knows or should have known of this conduct and fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective action. An employer may also be responsible for the acts of a nonemployee, with respect to sexual harassment of an employee, applicant, or person providing services pursuant to a contract in the workplace, where the employer, or an agent or supervisor of the employer, knows or should have known of the conduct and fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective action. In reviewing a case involving the acts of a nonemployee, the extent of the employer’s control and any other legal responsibility which the employer may have with respect to the conduct of the nonemployee shall be considered. An entity shall take all
				  reasonable steps to prevent harassment from occurring. Loss of a tangible job benefit shall not be necessary in order to establish harassment.(2) The provisions of this subdivision are declaratory of existing law, except for the new duties imposed on employers with regard to harassment.(3) An employee of an entity subject to this subdivision is personally liable for harassment prohibited by this section that is perpetrated by the employee, regardless of whether the employer or covered entity knows or should have known of the conduct and fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective action.(4) (A) For purposes of this subdivision only, “employer” means a person regularly employing one or more persons or regularly receiving the services of one or more persons providing services pursuant to
				  a contract, or a person acting as an agent of an employer, directly or indirectly, the state, or a political or civil subdivision of the state, and cities. The definition of “employer” in subdivision (d) of Section 12926 applies to all provisions of this section other than this subdivision.(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), for purposes of this subdivision, “employer” does not include a religious association or corporation not organized for private profit, except as provided in Section 12926.2.(C) For purposes of this subdivision, “harassment” because of sex includes sexual harassment, gender harassment, and harassment based on pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition.(5) For purposes of this subdivision, “a person providing services pursuant to a contract” means a person who meets all of the

				  without undue hardship on the conduct of the business of the employer or other entity covered by this part. Religious belief or observance, as used in this section, includes, but is not limited to, observance of a Sabbath or other religious holy day or days, and reasonable time necessary for travel prior and subsequent to a religious observance.(m) For an employer or other entity covered by this part to fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an applicant or employee. Nothing in this subdivision or in paragraph (1) or (2) of subdivision (a) shall be construed to require an accommodation that is demonstrated by the employer or other covered entity to produce undue hardship to its operation.(n) For an employer or other entity covered by this part to fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee or

				  period for family care and medical leave.

The commission shall adopt a regulation specifying the elements of a reasonable request.(b)Notwithstanding subdivision (a), it shall not be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to refuse to grant a request for family care and medical leave by an employee if the employer employs less than 50 employees within 75 miles of the worksite where that employee is employed.(c)For purposes of this section:(1)“Child” means a biological, adopted, or foster child, a stepchild, a legal ward, or

If an employee takes a leave because of the employee’s own serious health condition, the employee may also elect, or the employer may also require the employee, to substitute accrued sick leave during the period of the leave. However, an employee shall not use sick leave during a period of leave in connection with the birth, adoption, or foster care of a child, or to care for a child, parent, or spouse with a serious health condition, unless mutually agreed to by the employer and the employee.(f)(1)During
