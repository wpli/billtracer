											  Hazardous materials: fluorescent lamps: recycling.The California Lighting Efficiency and Toxics Reduction Act prohibits, on and after January 1, 2010, except for certain specified circumstances, a person from manufacturing, selling, or offering for sale in the state specified general purpose lights that contain levels of hazardous substances prohibited by the European Union pursuant to the RoHS Directive, as specified.This bill, on and after January 1, 2011, would prohibit the sale or offering for sale in this state of luminaires and lighting fixtures that are intended for general lighting purposes and contain preheat ballasts for operation of preheat linear fluorescent lamps.The California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989, administered by the California Integrated Waste Management Board, requires reduction, recycling, and reuse of solid waste generated in the state to the maximum extent feasible in an efficient,
		cost-effective manner to conserve water, energy, and other natural resources.This bill would prohibit the distribution of moneys from energy efficiency investment funds or any other funds generated from usage-based charges on electricity distribution that are provided by California’s retail sellers of electricity to any manufacturer for the purchase and distribution of compact fluorescent lamps, unless the compact fluorescent lamps meet certain specifications, and the manufacturer of the compact fluorescent lamps, individually, collectively with other manufacturers, or through a stewardship organization, has implemented a residential fluorescent lamp recycling program for each residential fluorescent lamp, as defined, sold by retailers selling the manufacturer’s subsidized lamps. The bill would prohibit the distribution of moneys from funds generated from usage-based charges on electricity distribution that are provided by California’s retail sellers of electricity
		to a retailer, except moneys provided to a retailer through a manufacturer, unless the retailer has agreed to provide the public an in-store collection opportunity for the recycling of residential fluorescent lamps. The bill would prohibit manufacturers and retailers from using funds generated from usage-based charges on electricity distribution that are provided by California’s retail sellers of electricity for recycling activities.The bill would require the manufacturers of residential fluorescent lamps sold in this state, individually, collectively with other manufacturers, or through a stewardship organization, to establish and maintain a residential fluorescent lamp recycling program containing specified elements within 90 days of receiving the funds generated from usage-based charges. The bill would require a manufacturer, individually, collectively with other manufacturers, or through a stewardship organization, to submit an annual report on the
		implementation of the residential fluorescent lamp recycling program. The bill would require the board to establish an administrative fee, not to exceed $5,000 per manufacturer and bearing a reasonable relationship to actual costs, to be paid by the manufacturers to cover the cost of reviewing and approving the annual report and of oversight and enforcement of the program.Digest Key

                                NO  Bill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. This act shall be known, and may be cited, as the California Fluorescent Lamp Toxics Reduction and Recycling Act.SEC. 2. (a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:(1) California policy, including the California Lighting Efficiency and Toxics Reduction Act (Chapter 534 of the Statutes of 2007), has put California on a path of transition from incandescent lamps to more energy-efficient lighting, including substantially increased utilization of fluorescent lighting.(2) Many existing lighting choices contain toxic materials. Most fluorescent lighting products contain mercury. California prohibits disposing of lighting products containing hazardous levels of metal in the solid waste stream. The hazardous material in
		  waste lighting products can be reduced and managed through recycling, but recycling opportunities are currently inconvenient or nonexistent for most consumers.(3) Fluorescent lighting products delivering the same level of light at the same level of efficiency can have varying levels of mercury. The Department of General Services has adopted a procurement preference favoring low-mercury fluorescent lamps.(4) In 2007, the Legislature enacted the California Lighting Efficiency and Toxics Reduction Act (Chapter 534 of the Statutes of 2007), which directed the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) to convene a lighting task force to consider and make policy recommendations to the Legislature for designing a statewide collection program for end-of-life fluorescent lights. On September 1, 2008, the task force submitted recommendations to the Legislature on the need and options
		  for a convenient statewide system for the collection and recycling of fluorescent lamps for residential generators.(b) It is the intent of the Legislature to have an established system for the recycling of residential generated fluorescent lamps that is free and convenient for end users. SEC. 3. Section 25210.9 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:25210.9. (a) Except as provided in subdivisions (e), (f), and (g), on and after January 1, 2010, a person shall not manufacture general purpose lights for sale in this state that contain levels of hazardous substances that would result in the prohibition of those general purpose lights being sold or offered for sale in the European Union pursuant to the RoHS Directive.(b) Except as provided in subdivisions (e), (f), and (g), on and after January 1, 2010, a person shall not sell or offer for sale in this state a general purpose light under any of the following circumstances:(1) The general purpose light being sold or offered
				  for sale was manufactured on and after January 1, 2010, and contains levels of hazardous substances that would result in the prohibition of that general purpose light being sold or offered for sale in the European Union pursuant to the RoHS Directive.(2) The manufacturer of the general purpose light sold or being offered for sale fails to provide the documentation to the department required by subdivision (h).(3) The manufacturer of the general purpose light being sold or offered for sale does not provide the certification required in subdivision (i).(c) For the purposes of this section, “RoHS Directive” means Directive 2002/95/EC, adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union on January 27, 2003, on the restriction of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment,
				  as amended thereafter by the Commission of European Communities (13.2.2003 Official Journal of the European Union).(d) The department shall determine the products covered by the RoHS Directive by reference to authoritative guidance published by the United Kingdom implementing the RoHS Directive in that country.(e) (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), subdivisions (a), (b), (h), and (i) do not apply to high output and very high output linear fluorescent lamps greater than 32 millimeters in diameter and preheat linear fluorescent lamps.(2) On or after January 1, 2014, the department shall determine, in consultation with companies that manufacture lamps specified in paragraph (1) in the United States, if those lamps should be subject to the requirements of subdivisions (a), (b),
				  (h), and (i), taking into consideration changes in lamp design or manufacturing technology that will allow for the removal or reduction of mercury.(3) On and after January 1, 2011, new luminaires and lighting fixtures intended for general lighting purposes and containing preheat ballasts for operation of preheat linear florescent lamps shall not be sold or offered for sale in this state.(f) On and after January 1, 2012, for high intensity discharge lamps and compact fluorescent lamps greater than nine inches in length, subdivisions (a), (b), (h), and (i) shall be applicable.(g) On and after January 1, 2014, for state-regulated general service incandescent lamps and enhanced spectrum lamps as defined in subdivision (k) of Section 1602 of Title 20 of the California Code of Regulations, subdivisions (a), (b), (h),
				  and (i) shall be applicable.(h) A manufacturer of general purpose lights sold or being offered for sale in California shall prepare and, at the request of the department, submit within 28 days of the date of the request, technical documentation or other information showing that the manufacturer’s general purpose lights sold or offered for sale in this state comply with the requirements of the RoHS Directive.(i) A manufacturer of general purpose lights sold or being offered for sale in California shall provide, upon request, a certification to a person who sells or offers for sale that manufacturer’s general purpose lights. The certification shall attest that the general purpose lights do not contain levels of hazardous substances that would result in the prohibition of those general purpose lights being sold or offered for sale in California. Alternatively, the manufacturer may
				  display the certification required by this subdivision prominently on the shipping container or on the packaging of general purpose lights.(j) The department may adopt regulations to implement and administer this article.SEC. 4. Chapter 7.3 (commencing with Section 42420) is added to Part 3 of Division 30 of the Public Resources Code, to read:
