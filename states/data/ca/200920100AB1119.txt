						EmmersonFebruary 27, 2009 An act to add Section 3260.05 to the Civil Code, relating to works of improvement. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1119, as amended, Emmerson.
											  Works of improvement: payments.Existing law requires an owner of a private work of improvement to release retention proceeds withheld from any payment within 45 days after the date of completion. Existing law requires a public entity to release retention proceeds withheld from any payment by the public entity within 60 days after the date of completion. Existing law requires an original contractor to pay any subcontractor within 10 days from the time that all or any portion of retention proceeds are received by the original contractor. Existing law requires an original contractor or subcontractor to pay any subcontractor within 10 days from the time of receipt of each progress payment, unless otherwise agreed to in writing. Existing law imposes a penalty of 2% on the amount due per month on funds that are improperly withheld in a contract dispute relating to public and private works of improvement, as specified. The Contractors’ State License Law provides for the licensing and regulation of
		contractors by the Contractors’ State License Board.Existing law requires any person or corporation that has contracted to do business with a public utility to pay any subcontractor within 15 working days of receipt of each progress payment from the public utility, except as specified. Existing law also requires a state agency that fails to make any progress payment within 30 days after receipt of the payment request to pay interest at the rate of 10% per year.This bill would, notwithstanding any other provisions, require the owner to pay the contractor within 30 days of a demand for payment, except as specified, for 
		a contract for a public or private work of improvement with respect to contracts entered into on or after January 1, 2010, and would subject a licensed contractor under the Contractors’ State License Law to disciplinary action by the Contractors’ State License Board for a violation of these provisions. The bill would require all owners to release retention proceeds withheld from any payment within a 45-day period, and, upon receipt of all or any portion of the retention proceeds or final payment, or any progress payment, would require an original contractor or subcontractor to pay his or her subcontractors within a 7-day period. The bill would also make the 2% penalty described above applicable to all owners of private and public works of improvement. The bill would additionally provide that the prevailing party in any action for the collection of funds wrongfully withheld
		is entitled to attorney’s fees and costs state the intent of the Legislature to reconsider prompt payment statutes regarding public and private works of improvement to aid in their clarity and application.Digest Key

If any amount is wrongfully withheld in violation of this subdivision, the contractor shall be entitled to the penalty specified in subdivision (g).(d)Subject to subdivision (f), within seven days from the date that all or any portion of any
				  progress payment is received by the original contractor or subcontractor, the original contractor or subcontractor shall pay to any subcontractor, unless otherwise agreed to in writing, the respective amounts allowed the subcontractor on account of the work performed by the subcontractor, to the extent of each subcontractor’s interest therein.(e)The retention proceeds or final payment withheld from any payment by the owner from the original contractor, or by the original contractor from any subcontractor, shall be subject to the following requirements:(1)(A)Within 45 days after the date of completion, or 100 days after cessation of labor, the retention proceeds or final payment withheld by the owner shall be released. “Date of completion,” for purposes of this subdivision, means any of the following:(i)The date of issuance of any certificate of occupancy covering the work by the public agency issuing the building permit.(ii)The date of completion indicated on a valid notice of completion recorded pursuant to Section 3093.(iii)The date of completion, as defined in Section 3086.(B)Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the release of retention proceeds or final payments withheld for any portion of the work of improvement that ultimately will become the property of a public agency, may be conditioned upon the acceptance of the work by the public agency.(2)Subject to subdivision (f), within
				  seven days from the date that all or any portion of the retention proceeds or final payment is received by the original contractor, the original contractor shall pay, to each of its subcontractors from which the retention proceeds or final payment has been withheld, each subcontractor’s share of the retention proceeds or final payment received.

Within seven days of acceptance of the disputed work, the owner or original contractor shall release the retained portion of the disputed payment.(g)If any
				  payment is not made within the time periods required by this section, the owner, original contractor, or subcontractor withholding the unpaid amount shall be subject to a charge of 2 percent per month on the improperly withheld amount, in addition to any interest otherwise due. Additionally, in any action for the collection of funds wrongfully withheld, the prevailing party shall be entitled to attorney’s fees and costs.(h)As applied to licensees under the Contractors’ State License Law (Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 7000) of Division 3 of the Business and Professions Code), a violation of this section shall also constitute a cause for disciplinary action under that chapter, and the sanctions authorized under this section shall be enforced by the Contractors’ State License Board.(i)The remedies authorized pursuant to this
				  section are separate from, and in addition to, any other remedy authorized by law, and shall also be enforceable by civil, administrative, or criminal proceedings.(j)It shall be against public policy for any party to require any other party to waive any provision of this section.
