						TorricoFebruary 27, 2009An act to amend Section 272 of the Penal Code, relating to crimes. An act to add Section 3005 to the Penal Code, relating to parole. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1211, as amended, Torrico.
											  Contributing to delinquency of minors: criminal street gang participant. Parole: conditions.Existing law authorizes the imposition of various conditions on persons released from prison on parole. Under existing law, one of the conditions imposed upon a prisoner released on parole is that the prisoner agree to be subject to search or seizure by a parole officer or other peace officer at any time of the day or night, with or without a search warrant and with or without cause. If the prisoner does not agree to that condition of release, he or she loses worktime credits earned and may not be released from prison until he or she agrees to that condition or the entire term of imprisonment has expired, as specified.This bill would, instead, require that any person being released on parole who was not committed to prison for a registerable sex offense, a serious felony, a violent felony, or any felony that directly or indirectly involved
		violence or the threat of violence, and who does not have a prior conviction for a serious or violent felony, be released on parole with only one condition. This bill would provide that the one condition imposed on an eligible parolee would be that he or she agree in writing to be subject to search or seizure by a parole officer or other peace officer at any time of the day or night, with or without a search warrant and with or without cause. This bill would provide that any eligible inmate who does not agree in writing to that condition shall lose worktime credit earned pursuant to Article 2.5 (commencing with Section 2930) of Chapter 7 on a day-for-day basis and shall not be released until he or she either agrees in writing to that condition or has no remaining worktime credit, whichever occurs first. This bill would also provide that a parolee’s refusal to submit to a search or seizure while on parole is not grounds to revoke his or her parole.Under existing law, every person who commits an act or omits the performance of any duty which causes a minor to become a dependent of the court, or any person who induces a minor to fail to conform to a lawful order, is guilty of a misdemeanor.This bill would additionally provide that any person who omits the performance of any duty which causes a minor to become an active participant in a criminal street gang, as specified, is guilty of a misdemeanor. Because the bill would create a new crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by
			 this act for a specified reason.Digest Key
