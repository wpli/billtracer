						LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1268, Gaines.
											  Financial institutions.Existing law provides for the regulation and licensure by the Commissioner of Financial Institutions of state-chartered banks and credit unions, money transmitters, persons engaged in the business of issuing travelers checks, business and industrial development corporations, and corporations engaging in the business of selling, in this state, payment instruments issued by it. Each of the laws regulating these licensees establishes various enforcement provisions for violations of those laws.This bill would repeal specified portions of those enforcement provisions. The bill would recast, in one body of law, the enforcement provisions applicable to those licensees and would also recast various other provisions applicable to those licensees. The bill would recast provisions establishing the Deputy Commissioner of Financial Institutions for the Division of Credit Unions. The bill would recast provisions making it a crime for
		the deputy commissioner to fail to report to the commissioner information regarding the insolvency or unsafe condition of a licensee, if the deputy commissioner has knowledge of those facts. The bill would make other related changes, and would make other changes related to bank and trust company depositaries and stock acquisitions.Existing law authorizes the commissioner to examine the books, accounts, records, files, and any office of a credit union. Existing law authorizes the commissioner to take possession of the property and business of a credit union if the commissioner finds, among other things, that the credit union has inadequate capital or is insolvent.This bill would require the officers and employees of a credit union to exhibit the securities, books, records, and accounts to the examiners, on request. The bill would authorize the commissioner to take possession of the property and business of the credit union
		if the commissioner finds that the credit union has inadequate net worth, as defined, or is insolvent. The bill would also authorize the commissioner to call a meeting of the board of directors of a credit union, as specified.Existing law prohibits a corporation from engaging in the trust business unless it complies with specified requirements. Existing law exempts from those requirements, among others, certain persons or corporations acting as a trustee or any person appointed as a receiver, trustee, or other fiduciary by the court.This bill would exempt professional fiduciaries from those requirements.Digest Key

							 8. Liquidation and ConservationIn this article, “Federal Insurance Agency” means the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the National Credit Union Administration, as appropriate, or their respective successors-in-interest.305.1. Upon taking possession of the property and business of any licensee, the commissioner has authority, and it is his or her duty, to collect all moneys due to the licensee and to do other acts as are necessary or expedient to collect, conserve, or protect the licensee’s assets, property, and business, and he or she shall proceed to conserve or liquidate the affairs of the licensee as provided in this article.305.2. No attachment shall be issued against the property of any licensee subject to conservation or liquidation pursuant to this article.305.3. Upon taking possession of the property and business of any licensee pursuant to Section 302, the commissioner may proceed to liquidate or conserve the licensee in the manner provided by this article.305.4. Upon taking possession of the property and business of a licensee pursuant to Section 302, the commissioner may tender to any person or persons an appointment as conservator, liquidator, receiver, or liquidating committee of the licensee.305.5. The commissioner shall supervise the acts of the conservator, liquidator, receiver, or liquidating committee appointed under this article and may remove the conservator, liquidator, receiver, or any or all members of the liquidating committee in his or her discretion.305.6. If required by the commissioner, the conservator, liquidator, receiver, or members of the liquidating committee appointed under this article shall provide proof of bond coverage that extends to the conservator, liquidator, receiver, or members of the liquidating committee. The bond shall include fraud, dishonesty, and faithful performance coverage. The premium for that bond shall be paid out of the assets of the licensee.305.7. (a) If the commissioner retains possession of the assets of the licensee for the purpose of liquidation or conservation, the commissioner shall, to the extent possible, use the services of civil service employees of the commissioner’s office, and the attorneys employed by the commissioner or the Department of Justice shall render all necessary legal services, as the commissioner may request.(b) The commissioner, from time to time, under his or her official seal, may appoint one or more special deputy commissioners as his or her agent or agents with the powers specified in the certificate of appointment to assist him or her in the duties of conservation or of liquidation and distribution. The
					 certificate of appointment shall be filed in the office of the commissioner and a certified copy in the office of the clerk of the county in which the head office of the licensee is located. The commissioner may employ counsel and procure expert assistance and advice as may be necessary in the liquidation and distribution of the assets of the licensee and for that purpose may retain any of the officers or employees of the licensee as the commissioner may deem necessary.305.8. The compensation of civil service employees, special deputies, counsel, and other employees and assistants appointed to assist in the conservation or liquidation of any licensee and the distribution of its assets and all expenses of supervision and liquidation shall be fixed by the commissioner and shall be paid out of the funds of the licensee in the hands of the commissioner. The expenses of liquidation shall be reported to the court upon each application for payment of a dividend.305.9. If a licensee is not insured by a Federal Insurance Agency, upon the commissioner taking possession of the business and property of the licensee, the superior court of the State of California for the county in which the head office of the licensee is located shall have exclusive original jurisdiction of all proceedings relating thereto and of any action or other proceedings brought under the provisions of this article. All papers relating to the proceeding, including copies of the certificate of appointment of any special deputy and the inventories required to be filed, shall be filed and be made a part of the record of the proceeding without the payment of any additional fees. No damages may be awarded in the proceeding but, if sought, may only be recovered in a separate
					 action.310. If the licensee whose property and business has been taken pursuant to Section 302 is insured by a Federal Insurance Agency, the commissioner may tender to the appropriate Federal Insurance Agency an appointment as conservator, liquidator, or receiver of the licensee. The commissioner shall determine whether the licensee whose property and business has been taken shall be liquidated or conserved. If the Federal Insurance Agency accepts the appointment, the Federal Insurance Agency shall have, in addition to any powers conferred by applicable federal law, the powers conferred on the commissioner pursuant to this article.310.1. The Federal Insurance Agency may be, and act as, a conservator, liquidator, or receiver without bond.310.2. If the Federal Insurance Agency accepts the appointment in accordance with Section 310.1, the rights of customers and other creditors of the insured licensee shall be determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of the laws of this state.310.3. The Federal Insurance Agency conservator, liquidator, or receiver shall possess with respect to the insured licensee all the powers, rights, and privileges given the commissioner under this article with respect to the conservation or liquidation of a licensee, as appropriate, and the property and assets of which he or she has taken possession, except insofar as the same may be in conflict with the provisions of applicable federal law.310.4. (a) The commissioner may sell to any other licensee any part or the whole of the business of a licensee that is subject to liquidation or conservatorship. The purchase and sale shall be approved by the purchasing licensee, as follows:(1) If the purchasing licensee is organized under the laws of this state, by two-thirds of all of its directors.(2) If the licensee is any licensee other than a licensee organized under the laws of this state, in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction under which the licensee is organized.(b) (1) Subject to any
					 applicable federal statutes and regulations, any bank or credit union organized under the laws of this state may, with the approval of two-thirds of all of its directors, purchase from the receiver of a national banking association or a federal credit union the whole or any part of the business of the national banking association or federal credit union.(2) Subject to any applicable federal statutes and regulations and any applicable laws of the jurisdiction under which a foreign corporation is organized, any foreign corporation or office of a foreign corporation that is licensed by the commissioner to transact business in this state and that is authorized to accept shares or deposits in this state, may purchase from the receiver of a national banking association or federal credit union the whole or any part of the business of the national banking association or federal credit union.(c) The provisions of Chapter 12 (commencing with Section 1200) and Chapter 13 (commencing with Section 1300) of Division 1 of Title 1 of the Corporations Code shall not apply to any purchase and sale of the type described in subdivision (a) or (b).(d) When a purchase and sale of the type described in subdivision (a) or (b) becomes effective, the licensee shall, ipso facto and by operation of law and without further transfer, substitution, act, or deed, to the extent provided in the agreement of the purchase and sale or in the order of the court approving the purchase and sale and except as withheld or limited by the agreement or by the order:(1) Succeed to the rights, obligations, properties, assets, investments, shares, deposits, demands, and agreements of the licensee whose business is sold, subject to the right of every customer of a licensee to withdraw his or
					 her shares or deposit in full on demand after the sale, irrespective of the terms under which the share or deposit was made.(2) Succeed to the rights, obligations, properties, assets, investments, shares, deposits, demands, and agreements of the licensee whose business is sold under all trusts, executorships, administrations, guardianships, conservatorships, agencies, and other fiduciary or representative capacities, to the same extent as though the purchasing licensee had originally assumed, acquired, or owned the same, subject to the rights of trustors and beneficiaries under the trusts so sold to nominate another or succeeding trustee of the trust so sold after the sale.(3) Succeed to and be entitled to take and execute the appointment to executorships, trusteeships, guardianships, conservatorships, and other fiduciary and representative capacities to which the licensee whose
					 business is sold is or may be named in wills, whenever probated, or to which it is or may be named or appointed by any other instrument.(e) For purposes of subdivision (d), any purchase and sale of the type referred to in subdivision (d) shall be deemed to be effective at the time provided in the agreement of the purchase and sale or in the order of the court approving the purchase and sale.315. Whenever the commissioner deems it necessary in order to conserve the assets of any licensee that does not have federal deposit or share insurance for the benefit of the customers and other creditors, he or she may appoint a conservator of the licensee and require the conservator to post a bond as the commissioner deems proper. The conservator, under the direction of the commissioner, shall take possession of the books, records, and assets of every description of the licensee and take any action as the conservator may deem necessary to conserve the assets of the licensee pending further disposition of its business.315.1. A conservator appointed in accordance with Section 315 has all of the powers and rights with relation to the business and the property of the licensee for which he or she is appointed conservator as are possessed by the commissioner under this article with relation to a licensee of which the commissioner has taken possession, and the conservator is subject to the same obligations as are imposed upon the commissioner under this article. During the time that the conservator remains in possession of the licensee the rights of the licensee, and of all persons with respect thereto, subject to the other provisions of this article, are the same as if the commissioner had taken possession of the property and business of the licensee for the purposes of liquidation. All expenses of the
					 conservatorship shall be paid out of the assets of the licensee and shall be a lien thereon which shall be prior to any other lien. The conservator shall receive a salary in an amount no greater than that which would be paid by the commissioner to a special deputy in charge of the liquidation of a licensee.315.2. The commissioner may order an examination at the earliest possible date of a licensee for which the commissioner has appointed a conservator.315.3. While any licensee is in the hands of a conservator, the commissioner may require the conservator to set aside and make available for withdrawal by customers and for payment to other creditors on a ratable basis such amounts as in the opinion of the commissioner may safely be used for that purpose.315.4. The commissioner, in his or her discretion, may permit the conservator to receive shares or deposits, but any shares or deposits received while the licensee is in the hands of a conservator shall be held as trust funds and shall not be subject to any limitation as to payment or withdrawal. The shares or deposits shall be segregated and shall not be used to liquidate any indebtedness of the licensee existing at the time the conservator was appointed or for the payment of any later indebtedness incurred for the purpose of liquidating any indebtedness of the licensee existing at the time the conservator was appointed. The shares or deposits shall be kept on hand in cash, invested in direct obligations of the United States, or deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank.315.5. If the commissioner is satisfied that it may be done safely and that it would be in the public interest, he or she may terminate a conservatorship and permit the licensee for whom a conservator was appointed to resume the transaction of its business under the direction of its board, subject to any terms, conditions, restrictions, and limitations as the commissioner may prescribe.315.6. The conservator of a licensee that has been permitted to resume accepting member shares or deposits shall first cause a notice to be published in a newspaper of local circulation. The notice shall state the date on which the affairs of the licensee will be returned to its board and that the provisions of Section 315.4 will not be effective after 30 days from that date. The form of the notice and the newspaper in which the same is to be published shall be first approved by the commissioner. On the date of the publication of the notice, the conservator shall mail a copy of the notice to every person who made any deposit in the licensee after the date of the appointment of the conservator. The conservator shall address the copy of the notice to the persons who have made the deposits at the
					 addresses appearing upon the books of the licensee. The conservator shall also mail a similar notice to every person making a deposit in the licensee after the date of the publication of the notice and before the affairs of the licensee are returned to its board.315.7. The commissioner may assess and collect from all licensees for whom a conservator is appointed their ratable share of the costs incurred in the administration of this article.315.8. Any licensee that the commissioner has taken possession of pursuant to Section 302, and for which a conservator has been appointed pursuant to this article, may be reorganized under a plan that requires the consent of any of the following:(a) Customers and other creditors of the licensee representing at least 75 percent in amount of its total member shares or deposits and other liabilities as shown by the books of the licensee, excluding member shares or deposits and other liabilities which are to be satisfied in full under the provisions of the plan.(b) Stockholders owning at least two-thirds of the outstanding stock as shown by the books of the
					 licensee.(c) Members of the licensee.(d) Customers and other creditors of the licensee representing at least 75 percent in amount of its total shares or deposits and other liabilities as shown by the books of the licensee, excluding shares or deposits and other liabilities that are to be satisfied in full under the provisions of the plan, and, if applicable to the licensee, of stockholders owning at least two-thirds of its outstanding stock as shown by the books of the licensee.315.9. All customers, creditors, stockholders, if applicable, and other interested persons shall be given notice of any proposed plan of reorganization in the manner and at the times as the commissioner directs.315.10. No plan of reorganization shall become effective until the commissioner finds that the plan is fair and equitable to all customers, creditors, and stockholders, if applicable, and is in the public interest and until the commissioner approves the same in writing, subject to any conditions, restrictions, and limitations as the commissioner may prescribe.315.11. No creditor having security for the payment of his, her, or its claim shall be affected in his, her, or its right to enforce the security by the provisions of any plan for the reorganization of the licensee. Any plan of reorganization involving the reduction of claims of creditors shall apply only to that portion of a secured creditor’s loan that is not covered by the pledged security.315.12. When any plan of reorganization becomes effective, all books, records, and assets of the licensee shall be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of the plan and the affairs of the licensee shall be conducted by its board in the manner provided by the plan and under the conditions, restrictions, and limitations that may have been prescribed by the commissioner. When any plan of reorganization adopted and approved as herein provided becomes effective, all customers and other creditors and, if applicable, stockholders of the licensee, whether or not they have consented to the plan of reorganization, shall be fully and in all respects subject to and bound by the plan’s provisions and the claims of all customers and other creditors shall be treated as if they had consented to the
					 plan of reorganization.320. Upon taking possession of the property and business of a licensee that does not have federal deposit or share insurance, the commissioner may sell, compromise, or compound any bad or doubtful debt owing the licensee for a principal sum not exceeding ten thousand dollars ($10,000), upon those terms as the commissioner may deem proper. If the principal sum thereof exceeds ten thousand dollars ($10,000), the commissioner may compromise, compound, or sell the debt upon those terms as the court may approve. If it appears improbable that a recovery on a debt can be had, and that the costs of an action to collect would be lost, and the principal sum thereof does not exceed five hundred dollars ($500), the commissioner may determine that no suit thereon shall be brought. If the principal sum of
					 that debt exceeds ten thousand dollars ($10,000), the commissioner may determine that no suit thereon be brought after obtaining approval of the court.320.1. The commissioner may sell any real or personal property of the licensee for cash or on credit and on any other terms and conditions as the commissioner may deem proper, subject to the approval of the court.320.2. (a) The commissioner may, with the approval of the court, sell any part or the whole of the business of a licensee to any other licensee. The purchase and sale shall be approved by the purchasing licensee, as follows:(1) If the purchasing licensee is organized under the laws of this state, by two-thirds of all of its directors.(2) If the licensee is any licensee other than a licensee organized under the laws of this state, in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction under which the licensee is organized.(b) (1) Subject to any applicable federal
					 statutes and regulations, any bank or credit union organized under the laws of this state may, with the approval of two-thirds of all of its directors and of the commissioner, purchase from the receiver of a national banking association or a federal credit union the whole or any part of the business of the national banking association or federal credit union.(2) Subject to any applicable federal statutes and regulations and any applicable laws of the jurisdiction under which a foreign corporation is organized, any foreign corporation or any office of a foreign corporation that is licensed by the commissioner to transact business in this state and that is authorized to accept shares or deposits in this state, may, with the approval of the commissioner, purchase from the receiver of a national banking association or federal credit union the whole or any part of the business of the national banking association or federal credit union.(c) The provisions of Chapter 12 (commencing with Section 1200) and Chapter 13 (commencing with Section 1300) of Division 1 of Title 1 of the Corporations Code shall not apply to any purchase and sale of the type described in subdivision (a) or (b).(d) When a purchase and sale of the type described in subdivision (a) or (b) becomes effective, the purchasing licensee shall, by operation of law and without further transfer, substitution, act, or deed, to the extent provided in the agreement of the purchase and sale or in the order of the court approving the purchase and sale and except as withheld or limited by the agreement or by the order:(1) Succeed to the rights, obligations, properties, assets, investments, shares, deposits, demands, and agreements of the licensee whose business is sold, subject to the right of
					 every customer of the licensee whose shares or deposit is sold to withdraw his or her shares or deposit in full on demand after the sale, irrespective of the terms under which the deposit was made.(2) Succeed to the rights, obligations, properties, assets, investments, shares, deposits, demands, and agreements of the whose business is sold under all trusts, executorships, administrations, guardianships, conservatorships, agencies, and other fiduciary or representative capacities, to the same extent as though the purchasing licensee had originally assumed, acquired, or owned the same, subject to the rights of trustors and beneficiaries under the trusts so sold to nominate another or succeeding trustee of the trust so sold after the sale.(3) Succeed to and be entitled to take and execute the appointment to executorships, trusteeships, guardianships, conservatorships, and other
					 fiduciary and representative capacities to which the licensee whose business is sold is or may be named in wills, whenever probated, or to which it is or may be named or appointed by any other instrument.(e) For purposes of subdivision (d), any purchase and sale of the type referred to in subdivision (d) shall be deemed to be effective at the time provided in the agreement of the purchase and sale or in the order of the court approving the purchase and sale.320.3. Within six months after taking possession of the property and business of any licensee that does not have federal deposit or share insurance, the commissioner may terminate or adopt any executory contract to which the licensee may be a party, including leases of real or personal property. Claims for damages resulting from the termination of any contract or lease may be filed and allowed, but no claim of a landlord for damages resulting from the rejection of an unexpired lease of real property or under any covenant of the lease shall be allowed in an amount exceeding the rent reserved by the lease, without acceleration, for the year succeeding the date of the surrender of the premises plus the amount of any unpaid accrued rent without acceleration. Any claim shall be filed within 30 days
					 of the date of the termination or within the time that claims are to be filed under Section 320.10, whichever is longer.320.4. The commissioner, in his or her own name or in the name of the licensee, may execute, acknowledge, and deliver any and all conveyances and other instruments necessary or appropriate to effectuate the sale of any real or personal property or to effectuate any other transaction in connection with the liquidation of a licensee or the distribution of its assets. Any conveyance or other instrument executed by the commissioner pursuant to this authority shall be valid and effectual for all purposes as though the same had been executed by the officers of the licensee by authority of its board of directors. Whenever the commissioner sells any real property of the licensee a certified copy of the order of the court approving the sale shall be recorded in the county in which any part of the real
					 property is located.320.5. The commissioner, in the name of the delinquent licensee or in his or her own name, may prosecute and defend any and all actions and other legal proceedings appropriate or necessary to the liquidation of the licensee.320.6. The commissioner from time to time shall deposit all moneys coming into his or her hands in the course of the liquidation of the licensee in one or more state banks or state credit unions and in the event of the suspension or insolvency of the depositary shall be preferred before all other deposits.320.7. The commissioner shall make an inventory of the assets of the licensee in duplicate and file one in the office of the commissioner and one with the clerk of the county in which the head office of the licensee is located to be filed with the papers in the liquidation proceedings. The inventory shall be open for inspection at all reasonable times.320.8. When the time fixed for the presentation of claims has expired, the commissioner shall make in duplicate a full and complete list of all claims presented, including and specifying claims that have been rejected by the commissioner, and a list of all claims of customers as shown by the books or records of the licensee for which claims have not yet been presented, and shall file one copy of the list in the commissioner’s office and one with the clerk of the county in which the head office of the licensee is located to be filed with the papers in the liquidation proceedings. Before each application to the court for leave to declare a dividend, the commissioner shall file a supplemental list of claims presented since the last preceding list was filed, including and specifying any claims that
					 have been rejected by him or her. The list of claims and of claims of customers as shown by the books or records of the licensee shall be open for inspection at all reasonable times.320.9. The commissioner shall cause notice to be given by advertisement in any newspapers of general circulation as he or she may select weekly for three consecutive months, calling on all persons who have claims against the licensee to present the same to the commissioner and make legal proof thereof at a place to be specified therein and within four months of the date of the first publication of the notice, which date shall be specified in the notice. The notice shall also state that all claims other than those of customers appearing upon the books or records of the licensee shall be forever barred if not filed within the four months’ period and that all claims of customers appearing upon the books or records of the licensee will be forever barred, except as herein provided, if not filed
					 prior to the filing of a petition for a final dividend. The commissioner shall also mail a similar notice to all persons, including customers whose names appear as creditors upon the books of the licensee and whose addresses appear upon the books or records of the licensee, and shall enclose therewith a printed form of notice of claim.320.10. All claims of every kind against the licensee or against any property owned or held by the licensee shall be presented to the commissioner in writing verified by the claimant or someone on his or her behalf within four months of the date of the first publication of the notice to creditors. Any claim, other than the claim of a customer whose claim appears upon the books or records of the licensee, not presented within the four months’ period shall be forever barred and any claim of a customer whose claim appears upon the books or records of the licensee that is not so presented prior to the date of the filing of the petition of the commissioner with the court for approval of the payment of the final dividend shall be forever barred except as to any moneys remaining after all debts for
					 which claims were duly filed have been paid in full with interest. If the commissioner doubts the validity of any claim, he or she may reject the claim and serve notice of the rejection upon the claimant either by mail or personally. An affidavit of the mailing or personal service of the notice shall be prima facie evidence of the receipt thereof and shall be filed with the commissioner. Any action upon a rejected claim shall be brought within three months after the date of mailing or personal service of the notice of rejection.320.11. At any time and from time to time after the expiration of the time fixed for the presentation of claims, the commissioner, after obtaining approval of the court, may declare and pay one or more dividends upon all approved claims out of the funds remaining in his or her hands after the payment of expenses and after setting aside an amount sufficient to pay to all customers, who have not yet filed claims but whose claims appear upon the books or records of the licensee, their pro rata share of the funds then available for the payment of a dividend. At any time after the expiration of one year from the date of the first publication of notice to creditors and after obtaining the approval of the court, the commissioner may declare and pay a final dividend.320.12. (a) Expenses and claims of unsecured creditors have priority in the following order:(1) Expenses of liquidation and approved claims for fees and assessments due the department.(2) Approved claims given priority under other provisions of state or federal law, including, but not limited to, Sections 320.6 and 330.(3) Approved claims for “deposits,” as that term is defined in 12 U.S.C. Section 1813(l), but including obligations of the type described in 12 U.S.C. Section 1813(l)(5)(A) and (B).(4) Approved
					 claims for other general liabilities.(5) Approved claims for obligations subordinated to deposits and other general liabilities.(b) Interest shall be given the same priority as the claim on which it is based, but no interest shall be paid on any claim until the principal of all claims within the same class has been paid or adequately provided for in full.(c) Any funds remaining shall be paid to the members or shareholders, as appropriate.320.13. Objections to any claim not rejected by the commissioner may be made by any person interested by filing a copy of the objection with the commissioner, who shall present the copy to the court at the time of the next application for approval of the declaration of a dividend. The court shall thereupon dispose of the objections or may order a reference for that purpose, and should the objections to any claim be sustained by the court or by the referee, the claim shall not be allowed by the commissioner until the claimant has established the claim by judgment.320.14. Dividends remaining unpaid and any sums available for payment of shares or deposits for which no claim was filed, which remain in the hands of the commissioner six months after the order for the payment of a final dividend, shall be deposited in the State Treasury. The shares or deposits shall be deemed to have been received under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 1500) of Title 10 of Part 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and shall be subject to claim or other disposition as provided in that chapter. The commissioner may pay over the moneys held by him or her to the persons respectively entitled thereto at any time prior to depositing the shares or deposits in the State Treasury, upon being furnished satisfactory evidence of the persons’ right to the same.320.15. Whenever, under the provisions of this article, the commissioner is required to transmit unclaimed money or other unclaimed property to any state officer for deposit in the State Treasury, the commissioner, upon request of the Controller, shall transmit to the Controller all signature cards and any other identifying information available from the records of the licensee, covering the money or other property. Upon receipt by the Controller of the signature cards or other identifying information, the licensee and the commissioner shall be relieved of all responsibility therefor. The signature cards and other identifying information may be destroyed or otherwise disposed of by the Controller whenever, in his or her discretion, their further retention by him or her is no longer required in
					 the interest of the customers or the state.320.16. All approved claims of customers and other creditors shall bear interest at the rate provided by law on judgments from the date that the commissioner takes possession of the property and business of the licensee.320.17. If the licensee has in its possession for safekeeping or storage any jewelry, plate, money, specie, bullion, stocks, bonds, securities, valuable papers, or other valuable personal property, or has rented any vaults, safes, or safe-deposit boxes, the commissioner shall cause to be mailed, by registered mail, postage prepaid, to any known person claiming to be or appearing on the books of the licensee to be the owner of the property or to the person in whose name the safe, vault, or box stands a notice notifying the person to remove all of the personal property within a specified fixed period of not less than 60 days.320.18. On the last day fixed in the notice for the removal of the property or on the date when the property is removed or the box surrendered, any contract between the person owning the property or holding the box and the licensee shall cease and the amount of the unearned prepaid rent or charges, if any, shall become a debt of the licensee to the person.320.19. If any property is not removed within the time fixed by the notice mailed by the commissioner, the commissioner may dispose of the property as the court, on application thereto, shall direct. The commissioner may cause any safe, vault, or box to be opened in his or her presence or in the presence of one of the special deputy commissioners and of a notary not an officer or employee of the licensee or of the commissioner. The contents thereof, if any, shall be sealed by the notary in a package upon which the notary shall distinctly mark the name and address of the person in whose name the safe or box stands upon the books of the licensee and shall attach thereon a list and a description of the property within the package. The package so sealed and addressed, together with the list and
					 description may be kept by the commissioner in one or more of the safes or boxes of the licensee or elsewhere until delivered to the person whose name it bears or until otherwise disposed of as directed by the court.320.20. (a) When the commissioner has completed the liquidation of the licensee, he or she shall petition the court for an order declaring the licensee duly wound up and dissolved.(b) After any notice as the court may direct and a hearing, the court may make an order declaring the licensee duly wound up and dissolved. The order shall declare all of the following:(1) The licensee has been duly wound up.(2) A final franchise tax return, if any, as described by Section 23332 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, has been filed with the Franchise Tax Board as required under Part 10.2
					 (commencing with Section 18401) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, and any tax or penalty due under the Corporation Tax Law has been paid, and the licensee’s known debts and liabilities have been paid or adequately provided for, or any taxes, penalties, debts, and liabilities have been paid so far as the licensee’s assets permitted, as the case may be. If there are known debts or liabilities for the payment of which adequate provision has been made, the order shall describe the provision, setting forth any information necessary to enable the creditor or other person to whom payment is to be made to appear and claim payment of the debt or liability.(3) All known assets of the licensee have been distributed to its shareholders or wholly applied on account of the licensee’s debts and liabilities.(4) The licensee is dissolved.(c) The court may make additional orders and grant further relief as it deems proper upon the evidence submitted.(d) Upon the making of the order declaring the licensee dissolved, the corporate existence of the licensee shall cease, except for the purposes of any necessary further winding up.(e) Upon the making of the order declaring the licensee dissolved, the commissioner shall file with the Secretary of State a copy of the order, certified by the clerk of the court.320.21. Whenever this article requires court approval of any step in the liquidation proceedings, approval shall be given after a hearing upon notice as the court may direct. At the hearing, the court may by order approve the actions of the commissioner for which he or she has petitioned the court’s approval or it may, by appropriate order, otherwise direct the commissioner in the matter in connection with which the petition was filed.320.22. Whenever, in the opinion of the commissioner, the liquidation or reorganization of any licensee taken in charge by him or her would be facilitated, or the public interests and the interests of customers or stockholders would be served, the commissioner may borrow money on behalf of the licensee from any federal agency authorized to lend money to receivers, trustees, liquidating agents, or other agents or supervisory authorities in charge of licensees that are closed or in process of liquidation and, with approval of the court, the commissioner may secure any borrowings by the pledge of the assets of the licensee in any manner and amount the commissioner deems necessary, proper, or expedient.325. Whenever any licensee is being liquidated or whenever the trust business of any licensee has been discontinued and the licensee has in its possession money or other property held by it in trust or for safekeeping and the beneficiaries or persons entitled thereto are unknown or cannot be found, the commissioner or the licensee, upon obtaining approval of the superior court of the county in which the liquidation proceedings are pending or in which the head office of the licensee is situated, may do the following:(a) In the case of money, deliver it to the Treasurer.(b) In the case of other property, deliver it to the Controller for deposit in the State
