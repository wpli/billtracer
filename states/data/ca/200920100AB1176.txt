						AmmianoFebruary 27, 2009 An act to repeal and add Section 53395.8 of the Government Code, and to amend Section 96.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to infrastructure financing districts. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1176, Ammiano.
											  Infrastructure financing districts: City and County of San Francisco.Existing law specifically authorizes the City and County of San Francisco to create infrastructure financing districts, adopt infrastructure financing plans for those districts, and issue bonds financed by projected increases in ad valorem property taxes to fund certain public facilities, pursuant to a specified procedure. Existing property tax law establishes various procedures and requirements with respect to the annual apportionment and allocation of ad valorem property tax revenues, including increased revenues from infrastructure financing districts.This bill would recast these provisions authorizing the City and County of San Francisco to create infrastructure financing districts that include specified waterfront property. This bill would also modify the procedures for San Francisco to adopt an infrastructure financing plan, and allocate projected increases in ad valorem property taxes to specified annual
		apportionments.Digest Key

                                NO  Bill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:(a) Areas of San Francisco, including portions of the San Francisco waterfront, are characterized by deteriorating conditions that cannot be remedied by private investment alone, and require the use of public financing mechanisms to finance the rectification of deteriorating conditions.(b) (1) The San Francisco waterfront, generally extending 7.5 miles from Fisherman’s Wharf to Candlestick Point, is a valuable public trust asset of the state and provides special maritime, navigational, recreational, cultural, and historical benefits to the people of the region and the state. The San Francisco
		  waterfront includes a 65-acre site known as Pier 70, which is the oldest continuously operating shipyard on the West Coast. For over 150 years, some portion of this site has been in use for shipbuilding and repair, steel production, and supporting heavy industrial uses. Until 1967, the United States Department of Defense occupied and controlled significant portions of Pier 70. In 2001, the Office of Historic Preservation determined that Pier 70’s approximately 40 historic buildings, structures, and features are eligible collectively for listing on the National Register of Historic Places as contributors to a Pier 70 historic district. Under the Burton Act (Ch. 1333, Stats. 1968, as amended) and the Burton Act transfer agreement, in 1969, the state conveyed the San Francisco waterfront to the City and County of San Francisco, through its port, in trust for the public and Burton Act trust purposes, subject to the obligation on the part of the City and County of San Francisco to assume fifty-five million
		  dollars ($55,000,000) in state debt obligations then existing relating to the waterfront properties. Under the San Francisco Charter, the people of San Francisco charged the Port of San Francisco with administration of the San Francisco waterfront and the responsibility for discharging the preexisting debt obligations. Since 1969, these preexisting debt obligations have limited the port’s ability to finance substantial investment in public trust facilities within its jurisdiction, resulting in deteriorating conditions along the San Francisco waterfront, including all of the following:(A) Since 2002, the port’s chief harbor engineer, who is responsible for assessing threats to life safety due to the condition of facilities within port jurisdiction, has conducted structural assessments of the port’s historic structures at Pier 70, that have resulted in the condemnation of 11 buildings and load and use restrictions in 14 other buildings at the
		  site.(B) The port’s Pier 70 structures were built before the adoption of seismic construction standards in the 1955 edition of the Uniform Building Code, and are constructed on bay fill or bay mud in locations designated by the United States Geological Survey as seismic hazard areas. Many older port facilities may be unsafe during a large seismic event due to the lack of seismic standards governing their construction and the liquefaction risk associated with port property.(C) Pier 70 has been used for heavy industrial uses for more than 150 years and is adjacent to the Potrero powerplant. Pier 70 and surrounding property are industrial brownfields known to be contaminated by heavy metals, hydrocarbons, and other pollutants. The historic buildings at Pier 70 will require significant investment to abate hazardous materials prior to demolition or rehabilitation.(D) The port’s Pier 70 waterfront contains numerous deteriorating piles that are the remnants of former pile-supported structures and no longer serve a useful purpose.(2) Beginning in the early 1990s, in response to economic and land use needs of the port and as directed by the San Francisco electorate, the port undertook a public planning process related to the improvement and development of the San Francisco waterfront. This process resulted in the port’s adoption of a waterfront land use plan in 1997, which identified Pier 70 as the most significant mixed-use development opportunity in the port’s southern waterfront.(3) Pursuant to the San Francisco Administrative Code, the port in 2006 developed a capital plan identifying public facilities necessary and convenient to the improvement, operation, and conduct of the
		  San Francisco waterfront. Among these public facilities are: (A) seismic and life-safety improvements to existing buildings, (B) rehabilitation, restoration, and preservation of certain historic piers and other historic structures, (C) shoreline restoration and structural repairs and improvements to piers, seawalls, wharves, and other maritime facilities, (D) remediation of hazardous materials, (E) removal of bay fill, (F) stormwater management facilities and other utility infrastructure improvements, and (G) public open space improvements, including those required by the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission’s San Francisco Waterfront Special Area Plan. In 2008, the estimated cost to implement the port’s capital plan was approximately one billion nine hundred million dollars ($1,900,000,000), an amount far in excess of the revenues projected to be available to the port for these purposes.(4) From 2006 to 2008, inclusive,
		  the port conducted a community master planning process for the Pier 70 district. The master plan calls for continued ship repair on approximately 15 acres of the site, the nomination of the Pier 70 National Register Historic District to the National Register of Historic Places, up to 3 million square feet of compatible infill development, up to 20 acres of waterfront open space, including a major new section of the San Francisco Bay Trail, and a development phasing schedule and financing plan that will allow the area to reunite with the surrounding central waterfront. The port projects that the costs to rehabilitate Pier 70, excluding costs associated with new development at the site, will exceed $1 billion in 2008 dollars and will require significant federal, state, and local funding.(c) In November 2008, San Francisco voters approved an amendment to the San Francisco Charter to provide revenues equal to up to 75 percent of projected new
		  hotel and payroll tax revenues from development in the Pier 70 area to fund historic preservation and infrastructure costs of rehabilitating the Pier 70 area. The port estimates that rehabilitation costs for the Pier 70 area will far exceed the additional revenues provided by the charter measure.(d) The Pier 70 area of the San Francisco waterfront is a valuable public trust asset of the state that provides special maritime, navigational, recreational, cultural, and historical benefits to the people of the region and the state. Realizing the goals of the port waterfront land use plan, the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission special area plan, and the port capital plan at Pier 70 is a matter of statewide significance, and rectifying the deteriorating conditions along the San Francisco waterfront caused by deferred maintenance since 1969 by providing a financing mechanism, through the use of incremental property tax
		  revenues, is a matter of statewide importance that will further the purposes of both the public trust and the Burton Act trust. Public facilities along the San Francisco waterfront to be financed pursuant to the infrastructure financing district law will increase public access to, or use or enjoyment of, public trust lands and are, therefore, facilities of statewide and communitywide significance.(e) The City and County of San Francisco wants to establish one or more infrastructure financing districts to finance public facilities along the San Francisco waterfront through its port, including a district in the Pier 70 area. Due to the extraordinary capital needs of the port, it is the intent of the Legislature to provide the City and County of San Francisco and its port the widest latitude, within the framework of the infrastructure financing district law, to create and operate infrastructure financing districts in the manner that provides the
		  optimal financing options to construct needed public facilities on public trust waterfront lands in order to meet the stated goals of statewide significance. In order to adapt the provisions of Chapter 2.8 (commencing with Section 53395) of Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 5 of the Government Code, relating to infrastructure financing districts, to these unique circumstances, this special act is necessary.SEC. 2. Section 53395.8 of the Government Code is repealed.SEC. 3. Section 53395.8 is added to the Government Code, to read:53395.8. (a) This section applies only to the City and County of San Francisco, and to any waterfront district.(b) In addition to the findings and declarations in Section 53395, the Legislature further finds and declares that consolidating in a single public agency the responsibility to administer waterfront lands in San Francisco that are subject to the public trust and the ability to capture property tax increment revenues to finance needed public facilities in those areas will further the objectives of the public trust and enjoyment of those trust lands by the people of the state.(c) For purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings except as otherwise
				  provided:(1) “Affected taxing entity” means any governmental taxing agency, except San Francisco and its local educational agencies, that levied or had levied on its behalf a property tax on all or a portion of the land located in the proposed district in the fiscal year prior to the designation of the district, all or a portion of which the district proposes to collect in the future under its infrastructure financing plan.(2) “Base year” means the fiscal year during which any infrastructure financing plan adopted under this chapter becomes effective.(3) “Board” means the Board of Supervisors of the City and County of San Francisco, which shall be the legislative body for any district formed in San Francisco.(4) “Debt” means loans, advance, or other

The board may adopt or amend one or more infrastructure financing plans for districts along the San Francisco waterfront according to the procedures in this section. A district may be divided into project areas, each of which may be subject to distinct time limitations established under this subdivision.(1) The board shall initiate proceedings for the establishment of a district by adopting a resolution of intention to establish the proposed district that does all of the following:(A) States an infrastructure financing district is proposed to be established and describes the boundaries of the proposed district. The boundaries may be described by reference to a map on file in the office of the clerk of the board.(B) States the type of public facilities proposed to be financed by the district.(C) States that incremental property tax revenue from San Francisco and some or all affected taxing entities within the district, but none of the local education agencies, may be used to finance these public facilities.(D) Directs the executive director of the port, or an appropriate official designated by the executive director, to prepare a proposed infrastructure financing plan.(2) The board shall direct the city clerk to mail a copy of the resolution of intention to any affected taxing entities.(3) The proposed infrastructure financing plan shall be consistent with the general plan of San Francisco, as
				  amended from time to time, and shall include all of the following:(A) A map and legal description of the proposed district, which may include all or a portion of the district designated by the board in its resolution of intention.(B) A description of the public improvements and facilities required to serve the development proposed in the district, including those to be provided by the private sector, those to be provided by governmental entities without assistance under this chapter, those public facilities to be financed with assistance from the proposed district, and those to be provided jointly. The description shall include the proposed location, timing, and projected costs of the public improvements and facilities.(C) A financing section that shall contain all of the following:(i) A provision that specifies the maximum portion of the incremental tax revenue of San Francisco and of any affected taxing entity proposed to be committed to the district, and affirms that the plan will not allocate any portion of the incremental tax revenue of the local educational agencies to the district.(ii) Limitations on the use of levied taxes allocated to and collected by the district that provide that incremental tax revenues allocated to a district must be used within the district for purposes authorized under this section, and that not less than 20 percent of the amount allocated to a district shall be set aside to be expended solely on shoreline restoration, removal of bay fill, or waterfront public access to or environmental remediation of the San Francisco waterfront.(iii) A projection of the amount
				  of incremental tax revenues expected to be received by the district, assuming a period of 45 years from the base year of the infrastructure financing plan.(iv) Projected sources of financing the public facilities to be assisted by the district, including debt to be repaid with incremental tax revenues, projected revenues from future leases, sales, or other transfers of any interest in land within the district, and any other legally available sources of funds.(v) A limitation on the number of dollars of levied taxes that may be divided and allocated to the district. Taxes shall not be divided or be allocated to the district beyond this limitation, except by amendment of the infrastructure financing plan pursuant to the procedures in this subdivision.(vi) A date on which the effectiveness of the infrastructure
				  financing plan and all tax allocations to the district will end and a time limit on the district’s authority to repay indebtedness with incremental tax revenues received under this chapter, not to exceed 45 years from the date of the board’s resolution of intent to issue bonds to be repaid with incremental tax revenues under this chapter.

				  upon any affected taxing entity. If no affected taxing entities exist within the district because the plan does not provide for collection by the district of any portion of property tax revenues allocated to any taxing entity other than San Francisco, the district has no obligation to any other taxing entity under this subdivision.(ix) A statement that the district will maintain accounting procedures in accordance, and otherwise comply, with Section 6306 of the Public Resources Code for the term of the plan.(D) For a Pier 70 district only, the Pier 70 enhanced financing plan may contain a provision meeting the requirements of Section 53396 that allocates a portion of the incremental tax revenue of San Francisco and of other designated affected taxing entities to the Pier 70 district.The
				  portion of incremental tax revenue of San Francisco to be allocated to the Pier 70 district must be equal to the portion of the incremental tax revenue of the county ERAF proposed to be committed to the Pier 70 district. In addition to all other requirements under this section, a Pier 70 district shall also be subject to the following additional limitations:(i) A Pier 70 district subject to a Pier 70 enhanced financing plan shall not be formed and become effective for at least three full fiscal years following the effective date of this section.(ii) Any Pier 70 enhanced financing plan shall contain all of the following:(I) A time limit on new ERAF-secured debt to finance the district, which may not exceed 20 fiscal years from the fiscal year in which any Pier 70 district subject to a Pier 70 enhanced financing
				  plan first issues debt. The ERAF-secured debt may be repaid over the period of time ending on the time limit established under clause (vi) of subparagraph (C). This time limit on new ERAF-secured debt shall not prevent a Pier 70 district from subsequently refinancing, refunding, or restructuring ERAF-secured debt if the debt is not increased and the time during which the debt is to be repaid is not extended beyond the time limit established under clause (vi) of subparagraph (C).(II) A statement that the Pier 70 district shall be subject to a limitation on the number of dollars of the ERAF share that may be divided and allocated to the Pier 70 district pursuant to the Pier 70 enhanced financing plan, including any amendments to the plan, which shall be established in consultation with the county auditor. This limitation and a schedule specifying the amount of the ERAF share that must be divided and allocated to the district in each succeeding
				  fiscal year until all ERAF-secured debt has been paid shall be included in the statement of indebtedness that the Pier 70 district files for the 19th fiscal year after the fiscal year in which any ERAF-secured debt is first issued. The ERAF share shall not be divided and shall not be allocated to the Pier 70 district beyond that limitation.(III) The limitations established by subclauses (I) and (II) may be amended only by amendment of this section. When the ERAF-secured debt, if any, has been paid, all moneys thereafter allocated to the ERAF share shall be paid into ERAF as taxes on all other property are paid. In addition, beginning in the 21st fiscal year after the fiscal year in which ERAF-secured debt is first issued, any portion of the ERAF share in excess of the amount required to meet the Pier 70 district’s ERAF-secured debt service obligations shall be paid into ERAF.(4) The proposed infrastructure financing plan shall be mailed to each affected taxing entity for review, together with any report required by the California Environmental Quality Act (Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code) that pertains to the proposed public facilities and any proposed development project for which the public facilities are needed, and shall be made available for public inspection. The report also shall be sent to the planning commission and the board.(5) Except as provided in subdivision (i), the board shall not enact a resolution proposing formation of a district and providing for the division of taxes of any affected taxing entities for use in the Pier 70 district as set forth in the proposed infrastructure financing plan unless a resolution approving the plan has been adopted by the governing body of each affected taxing entity that is proposed to be subject to division of
				  taxes as set forth in the proposed infrastructure financing plan, and that resolution has been filed with the board at or prior to the time of the hearing. A resolution approving the plan adopted by the governing body of an affected taxing entity shall be deemed the affected taxing entity’s agreement to participate in the plan for the purposes of Section 53395.19.(6) If the governing body of an affected taxing entity has not approved the infrastructure financing plan before the board considers the plan, the board may amend the infrastructure financing plan to remove the allocation of the tax revenues of the nonconsenting affected taxing entity. If a plan is so amended, the plan also shall be amended to provide that San Francisco will allocate to the Pier 70 district funds equal on a dollar-for-dollar basis to the tax revenues that the Pier 70 district would have received from the allocation of tax revenues of the affected taxing entity that is
				  removed from the plan.(7) The board shall hold a public hearing regarding the infrastructure financing plan that shall be scheduled on a date no earlier than 60 days after the plan has been sent to each affected taxing entity, or in the absence of any affected taxing entities, no earlier than 30 days after the plan has been lodged with the clerk of the board. Notice of the public hearing must be published not less than once a week for four successive weeks in a newspaper designated by the board for the publication of official notices in San Francisco, or if the board no longer designates a newspaper for the publication of official notices, a newspaper of general circulation serving primarily San Francisco residents. The notice shall state that the district will be established to finance public facilities, briefly describe the public facilities and the proposed financial arrangements, including the proposed commitment of incremental tax
				  revenue, describe the boundaries of the proposed district, and state the day, hour, and place when and where any persons having any objections to the proposed infrastructure financing plan, or the regularity of any of the previous proceedings, may appear before the board and object to the adoption of the proposed infrastructure financing plan by the board.(8) At the hour set in the required notices, the board shall proceed to hear and pass upon all written and oral objections. The hearing may be continued from time to time. The board shall consider any recommendations of affected taxing entities, and all evidence and testimony for and against the adoption of the infrastructure financing plan.(9) No election will be required to form the district, and at the conclusion of the hearing, the board may adopt an ordinance adopting the infrastructure financing plan, as drafted or as
				  modified by the board, or it may abandon the proceedings.(10) Any public or private owner of land that is not within an existing waterfront district, but that has any boundary line contiguous to a boundary of the waterfront district, may petition the board for inclusion of the land in the waterfront district without an election. As a condition to inclusion of its land in the waterfront district, the petitioning landowner shall acknowledge and agree that any portion of the land within 100 feet of the Bay Conservation and Development Commission shoreline (shoreline band) will include contiguous public access along the length of the shoreline band, improved and maintained to standards equal to adjacent waterfront public access ways on public land, as certified by the Bay Conservation and Development Commission. Nothing in this section is intended to affect or limit the authority of the Bay Conservation and Development Commission pursuant to
				  Sections 55500 to 66682, inclusive, or any other law. This procedure will apply to any petition to include the Mirant site in the Pier 70 district, but the board may amend the Pier 70 financing plan to include the Mirant site in the Pier 70 district only after the Director of Finance’s approval.(11) The ordinance creating a district and adopting or amending an infrastructure financing plan shall establish the base year for the district. The board may amend an infrastructure financing plan by ordinance to divide an established district into one or more project areas, to reduce the district area, or, to expand a waterfront district to include the petitioning landowner’s land in the district in accordance with the board’s established procedures. Any ordinance adopting or amending an infrastructure financing plan will be deemed an ordinance adopted for the purposes of Section 53395.23.(h) (1) All the amounts calculated under this subdivision shall be calculated after deducting the waterfront set-aside from the total amount of tax increment funds allocated to a district in the applicable fiscal year. The payments made under this subdivision to the affected taxing entities shall be allocated among the affected taxing entities in proportion to the percentage share of property taxes each affected taxing entity receives during the fiscal year the funds are allocated. The percentage share shall be determined without regard to any amounts allocated to a city, county, or city and county under Sections 97.68 and 97.70 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.(2) (A) Prior to incurring any debt, except loans or advances from San Francisco, a district may subordinate to the debt the amount required to be paid to an affected taxing entity under this subdivision, if any, provided the
				  affected taxing entity has approved these subordinations as provided in this paragraph.(B) At the time the district requests an affected taxing entity to subordinate the amount to be paid to it, the district shall provide the affected taxing entity with substantial evidence that sufficient funds will be available to pay when due both the debt service on the debt and the payments to the affected taxing entity required under this subdivision.(C) Within 45 days after receipt of the district’s request, the affected taxing entity shall approve or disapprove the request for subordination. An affected taxing entity may disapprove a request for subordination only if it finds, based upon substantial evidence, that the district will not be able to pay when due the debt payments and the amount required to be paid to the affected taxing entity. If the affected taxing entity does not act
				  within 45 days after receipt of the district’s request, the request to subordinate shall be deemed approved and its deemed approval shall be final and conclusive.(3) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:(A) The payments to be made under this subdivision are necessary in order to alleviate the financial burden and detriment that affected taxing entities may incur as a result of the adoption of an infrastructure financing plan, and payments made under this subdivision will benefit the district.(B) The payments to be made under this subdivision are the exclusive payments that are required to be made by a district to affected taxing entities during the term of an infrastructure financing plan.(4) Nothing in this section requires a
				  district, either directly or indirectly, as a measure to mitigate a significant environmental effect or as part of any settlement agreement or judgment brought in any action to contest the validity of a district under Section 53395.6, to make any other payments to affected taxing entities, or to pay for public facilities that will be owned or leased to an affected taxing entity.(i) The portion of taxes required to be allocated to the Pier 70 district under a duly adopted infrastructure financing plan shall be allocated and paid to the district by the county auditor or officer responsible for the payment of taxes into the funds of the respective taxing entities under the procedure contained in this subdivision. If the approved plan allocates to the Pier 70 district 100 percent of the incremental tax revenue of San Francisco, then the district shall not make a payment to ERAF, but if the plan allocates less than 100 percent of the incremental
				  tax revenue of San Francisco to the Pier 70 district, then the district shall pay a proportionate share of incremental tax revenue into ERAF.(1) No later than October 1 of each year, for each district for which the infrastructure financing plan provides for the division of taxes, the district shall file with the county auditor or officer a statement of indebtedness and a reconciliation statement for the previous fiscal year certified by the chief financial officer of the district.(2) Each statement of indebtedness shall contain all of the following:(A) For each debt the district has incurred or entered into, all of the following:(i) The date the district incurred or entered into the debt.(ii) The principal amount, term, purpose, interest rate, and total interest payable over the term of the debt.(iii) The principal amount and interest due in the fiscal year in which the statement is filed.(iv) The total amount of principal and interest remaining to be paid over the term of the debt.(B) The sum of the principal and interest due on all debts in the fiscal year in which the statement is filed.(C) The sum of principal and interest remaining to be paid on all debts.(D) The available revenues as of the end of the previous fiscal year.(3) The district may estimate the amount of principal or
				  interest, the interest rate, or term of any debt if the nature of the debt is such that the amount of principal or interest, the interest rate or term cannot be precisely determined. The district may list on a statement of indebtedness any debt incurred or entered into on or before the date the statement is filed.(4) Each reconciliation statement shall include all of the following:(A) A list of all debts listed on the previous year’s statement of indebtedness, if any.(B) A list of all debts not listed on the previous year’s statement of indebtedness, but incurred or entered into in the previous year and paid in whole or in part from incremental tax revenue received by the district. This listing may aggregate into a single item debts incurred or entered into in the previous year for a particular purpose, such as
				  relocation expenses, administrative expenses, consultant expenses, or remediation of hazardous materials.(C) For each debt described in subparagraph (A) or (B), all of the following shall be included:(i) The total amount of principal and interest remaining to be paid as of the later of the beginning of the previous year or the date the debt was incurred or entered into.(ii) Any increases or additions to the debt occurring during the previous year.(iii) The amount paid on the debt in the previous year from incremental tax revenue received by the district.(iv) The amount paid on the debt in the previous year from revenue other than incremental tax revenue received by the district.(v) The total amount of principal and interest remaining to be paid as of the end of the previous fiscal year.(D) The available revenues of the district as of the beginning of the previous fiscal year.(E) The amount of incremental tax revenue received by the district in the previous fiscal year.(F) The amount of available revenue received by the district in the previous fiscal year other than incremental tax revenue.(G) The sum of the amounts paid on all debts from sources other than incremental tax revenue, to the extent that the amounts are not included as available revenues under subparagraph (F).(H) The sum of the
				  amounts specified in subparagraphs (D) to (G), inclusive.(I) The sum of the amounts specified in clauses (iii) and (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (4).(J) The amount determined by subtracting the amount determined under subparagraph (I) from the amount determined under subparagraph (H). The amount determined under this paragraph shall be the available revenues as of the end of the previous fiscal year to be reported in the statement of indebtedness.(5) For the purposes of this paragraph, available revenues shall include all cash or cash equivalents held by the district that were received by the district under subparagraph (D) of paragraph (3) of subdivision (g) and all cash or cash equivalents held by the district that are irrevocably pledged or restricted to payment of a debt that the district has listed on
				  a statement of indebtedness. In no event shall available revenues include funds allocated to the waterfront set-aside.(6) For the purposes of this subdivision: (A) the amount a district is required to deposit into the waterfront set-aside shall constitute an indebtedness of the district, (B) no debt that a district intends to pay from the waterfront set-aside shall be listed on a statement of indebtedness or reconciliation statement as a debt of the district, and (C) any statutorily authorized deficit in or borrowing from funds in the waterfront set-aside shall constitute an indebtedness of the district.(7) The county auditor or officer shall allocate and pay, at the same time or times as the payment of taxes into the funds of the respective taxing agencies of the county, the portion of incremental tax revenues allocated to each district under the infrastructure financing plan.
				  The amount allocated and paid shall not exceed the amount of the district’s remaining debt obligations, as determined under subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2), minus the amount of available revenues as of the end of the previous fiscal year, as determined under subparagraph (D) of paragraph (2).(8) The statement of indebtedness constitutes prima facie evidence of the debts of the district.(A) If the county auditor or other officer disputes the amount of the district’s debts as shown on the statement of indebtedness, the county auditor or other officer, within 30 days after receipt of the statement, shall give written notice to the district thereof.(B) The district, within 30 days after receipt of notice under subparagraph (A), shall submit any further information it deems appropriate to substantiate the amount of
				  any debt that has been disputed. If the county auditor or other officer still disputes the amount of debt, final written notice of that dispute shall be given to the district, and the amount disputed may be withheld from allocation and payment to the district as otherwise required by paragraph (7). In that event, the auditor or other officer shall bring an action in the superior court for declaratory relief to determine the matter no later than 90 days after the date of the final notice.(C) In any court action brought under this paragraph, the issue shall involve only the amount of debt, and not the validity of any contract or debt instrument or any expenditures pursuant thereto. Payments to a trustee under a bond resolution or indenture of any kind or payments to a public agency in connection with payments by that public agency under a lease or bond issue shall not be disputed in any action under this paragraph. The matter shall be set for
				  trial at the earliest possible date and shall take precedence over all other cases except older matters of the same character. Unless an action is brought within the time provided for herein, the auditor or other officer shall allocate and pay the amount shown on the statement of indebtedness as provided in paragraph (7).(D) Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to permit a challenge to or attack on matters precluded from challenge or attack by reason of Sections 53395.6 and 53395.7. However, nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to deny a remedy against the district otherwise provided by law.(E) The Controller shall prescribe uniform forms consistent with this subdivision for a district’s statement of indebtedness and reconciliation statement. In preparing these forms, the Controller shall obtain the input of the San Francisco City Controller, the San
				  Francisco Tax Collector, and the port.(F) For the purposes of this subdivision, a fiscal year shall be a year that begins on July 1 and ends the following June 30.(j) (1) Prior to the adoption by the board of an infrastructure financing plan providing for tax increment financing under subparagraph (D) of paragraph (3) of subdivision (g), any affected taxing entity may elect to be allocated, and every local educational agency shall be allocated, all or any portion of the tax revenues allocated to the district under subparagraph (D) of paragraph (3) of subdivision (g) attributable to increases in the rate of tax imposed for the benefit of the taxing entity which levy occurs after the tax year in which the ordinance adopting the infrastructure financing plan becomes effective.(2) The governing
				  body of any affected taxing entity electing to receive allocation of taxes under this subdivision shall adopt a resolution to that effect and transmit the same, prior to the adoption of the infrastructure financing plan, to (A) the board, (B) the district, and (C) the official or officials performing the functions of levying and collecting taxes for the affected taxing entity. Upon receipt by the official or officials of the resolution, allocation of taxes under this section to the affected taxing entity shall be made at the time or times allocations are made under subdivision (a) of Section 33670 of the Health and Safety Code.(3) An affected taxing entity, at any time after the adoption of the resolution, may elect not to receive all or any portion of the additional allocation of taxes under this section by rescinding the resolution or by amending the same, as the case may be, and giving notice thereof to the board, the district, and the
				  official or officials performing the functions of levying and collecting taxes for the affected taxing entity. After receipt of a notice by the official or officials that an affected taxing entity has elected not to receive all or a portion of the additional allocation of taxes by rescission or amendment of the resolution, any allocation of taxes to the affected taxing entity required to be made under this section shall not thereafter be made but shall be allocated to the district. After receipt of a notice by the official or officials that an affected taxing entity has elected to receive additional tax revenues attributable to only a portion of the increases in the rate of tax, only that portion of the tax revenues shall thereafter be allocated to the affected taxing entity, and the remaining portion thereof shall be allocated to the district.(k) This section implements and fulfills the intent of Article 2 (commencing with Section 53395.10)
				  of Chapter 2.8 of Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 5 of the Government Code and of Article XIII B and Section 16 of Article XVI of the California Constitution. The allocation and payment to a district of the portion of taxes specified in subparagraph (D) of paragraph (3) of subdivision (g) for the purpose of paying principal of, or interest on, loans, advances, or indebtedness incurred for facilities under this section shall not be deemed the receipt by a district of proceeds of taxes levied by or on behalf of the district within the meaning or for the purposes of Article XIII B of the California Constitution, nor shall such portion of taxes be deemed receipt of proceeds of taxes by, or an appropriation subject to limitation of, any other public body within the meaning or for purposes of Article XIII B of the California Constitution or any statutory provision enacted in implementation of Article XIII B. The allocation and payment to a district of this portion of taxes shall not be deemed the appropriation by a
				  district of proceeds of taxes levied by or on behalf of a district within the meaning or for purposes of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.SEC. 4. Section 96.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to read:96.1. (a) Except as otherwise provided in Article 3 (commencing with Section 97), and in Article 4 (commencing with Section 98), for the 1980–81 fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter, property tax revenues shall be apportioned to each jurisdiction pursuant to this section and Section 96.2 by the county auditor, subject to allocation and payment of funds as provided for in subdivision (b) of Section 33670 of the Health and Safety Code and subparagraph (D) of paragraph (3) of subdivision (g) of Section 53395.8 of the Government Code, to each jurisdiction in the following manner:(1) For each tax rate area, each jurisdiction shall be allocated an amount of property tax revenue equal to the amount of property tax revenue allocated
				  pursuant to this chapter to each jurisdiction in the prior fiscal year, modified by any adjustments required by Section 99 or 99.02.(2) The difference between the total amount of property tax revenue and the amounts allocated pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be allocated pursuant to Section 96.5, and shall be known as the “annual tax increment.”(3) For purposes of this section, the amount of property tax revenue referred to in paragraph (1) shall not include amounts generated by the increased assessments under Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 75).(b) Any allocation of property tax revenue that was subjected to a prior completed audit by the Controller, pursuant to the requirements of Section 12468 of the Government Code, where all findings have been resolved, shall be deemed correct.(c) (1) Guidelines for legislation implementation issued and determined necessary by the State Association of County Auditors, and when adopted as regulations by either the Controller or the Department of Finance pursuant to Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, shall be considered an authoritative source deemed correct until some future clarification by legislation or court decision.(2) If a county auditor knowingly does not follow the guidelines referred to in paragraph (1), that county auditor shall inform the Controller of the reason or reasons for not following the guidelines. If the Controller disagrees with the stated reason or reasons for not following the guidelines, the provisions of paragraph (3) do not apply.(3) If, by
				  audit begun on or after July 1, 2001, or discovery by an entity on or after July 1, 2001, it is determined that an allocation method is required to be adjusted and a reallocation is required for previous fiscal years, the cumulative reallocation or adjustment may not exceed 1 percent of the total amount levied at a 1-percent rate of the current year’s original secured tax roll. The reallocation shall be completed in equal increments within the following three fiscal years, or as negotiated with the Controller in the case of reallocation to the Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund or school entities.(4) If it is determined that an allocation method is required to be adjusted as provided in paragraph (3), the county auditor shall, in the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which this determination is made, correct the allocation method in accordance with statute.SEC. 5. The Legislature finds and declares that a special law is necessary and that a general law cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section 16 of Article IV of the California Constitution because of the unique circumstances of the City and County of San Francisco. The facts constituting the special circumstances are: areas of San Francisco, including the portions of the San Francisco waterfront, are characterized by deteriorating conditions that cannot be remedied by private investment alone, and require the use of public financing mechanisms to finance the rectification of deteriorating conditions.
