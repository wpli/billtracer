											  Homelessness: Interagency Council on Homelessness.Under existing law, several agencies have prescribed responsibilities relating to homeless persons.This bill would, among other things, create the California Interagency Council on Homelessness, composed of specified members, to construct cross-agency and community cooperation in responding to homelessness, use a more efficient and supportive method in implementing evidence-based approaches to address homelessness, and, to the extent possible, plan to end homelessness in the state. This bill would also require the council to submit any reports or documents that it creates, within 90 days of being finalized by the council, to specified committees of the Legislature and to perform other duties as prescribed
		and performing duties, including preparation of a homelessness state plan, updated every 2 years. It would permit the council to apply for federal funding for its activities.Digest Key

                                NO  Bill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:(a) California has the highest rate of homelessness and the highest ratio of homeless people per resident, with 360,000 people sleeping on the streets or in shelters on any given night.(b) Homelessness is traumatic for those who suffer it, often leading to separated families, exacerbation of health conditions, a rise in avoidable emergency room use, social and academic delays among children, and greater likelihood of incarceration.(c) Many people who lack permanent shelter and the ability to access regular
		  support ricochet through separate and expensive public systems: overburdened corrections systems, overcrowded hospital emergency rooms, mental health programs, substance abuse treatment and detox facilities, shelters, and emergency housing. As a result, people experiencing chronic homelessness use a disproportionate share of state and local services.(d) Innovative approaches across the nation and within California show promise for reducing homelessness and the resulting impact on state services.(e) Changing the system and reducing homelessness requires coordination and cooperation among federal, state, and local governments, as well as private sector organizations.(f) Creation of a statewide coordinating council is an important and effective tool in supporting initiatives to end homelessness in California.(g) Creation of a statewide coordinating council would stem avoidable costs of maintaining the number of homeless persons and would, therefore, result in reducing avoidable costs to multiple programs.(h)Homelessness affects multiple systems in California, including housing, mental health and substance abuse, education, corrections, foster care, health care, and veterans services. Though most other states have adopted a plan to end homelessness because of the cost impact on all of these systems, California has not crafted a similar plan. A codified, structured interagency council on homelessness would help fill this gap.(h) Homelessness affects multiple
		  systems in California at a very high public cost, including housing, mental health and substance abuse, education, corrections, foster care, health care, and veterans services. Reducing homelessness would produce cost savings for all these systems. The state adopted a Ten-Year Chronic Homelessness Action Plan in February 2010, but has no mechanism in place to assess progress or hold state agencies accountable to the action steps in the plan. A codified, structured interagency council on homelessness would help fill this gap.(i) In November 2005, Governor Schwarzenegger created the Governor’s Homeless Chronic Homelessness Initiative, which included plans to form an interagency coordinating council to reduce homelessness. The
		  Business, Transportation and Housing Agency’s 2005–10 Consolidated Plan further indicates the importance of an interagency council on homelessness. Despite these intentions, a council has not met regularly or publicly since the Governor adopted his Homeless Chronic Homelessness Initiative.(j) California must give priority to developing consolidated, coordinated, and cooperative approaches to issues of homelessness, including, but not limited to, specific issues addressing homeless youth, families, veterans, parolees, victims of domestic violence, people with substance abuse or other mental health disorders, people experiencing chronic homelessness, seniors, and disabled people.(k) Working
		  within current costs, a revitalized Interagency Council on Homelessness will reduce duplication of efforts and the costs of homelessness and will redirect resources to more effective approaches, developing a more integrated system and eliminating fragmentation. Other states have created interagency councils without initial investment of resources.(l) California is not accessing all of the federal funds for homelessness that it should due to a lack of coordination among some agencies. Thirty other states apply for funds through the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Programs. Application for these funds could total millions of dollars, and requires state agency collaboration.SEC. 2. Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 8260) is added to Division 8 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, to read:
