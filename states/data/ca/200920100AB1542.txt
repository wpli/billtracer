					 creating savings to allow more Californians to have health care coverage and to provide for the sustainability of the health care system.(3) Integrate medical, mental health, and substance use disorder care.(4) Remove barriers to receiving appropriate health care.(d) It is further the intent of the Legislature that payors take into account the increased services and overhead associated with this practice model, and the potential savings from better managing chronic diseases and conditions, including, but not limited to, all of the following:(1) Coordination of care within the practice and between consultants, ancillary providers, and community resources.(2) Adoption and use of health information technology for quality improvement.(3) Increased patient access through advanced appointment systems, electronic patient portals, secure

					 manner.(b) A health care delivery model described in this section shall stress a team approach to providing comprehensive health care that fosters a partnership among the patient, the licensed health care provider acting within his or her scope of practice, other health care professionals, and, if appropriate, the patient’s family.1596.57.24302. Unless otherwise provided by statute, a medical home shall include all of the following characteristics:(a) Individual patients have an ongoing relationship with a physician or other licensed health care provider acting within his or her scope of practice, who is trained to provide first contact and continuous and comprehensive care, or if appropriate, provide referrals to health care professionals that provide continuous and comprehensive care.(b) A team of individuals at the practice level collectively take responsibility for the ongoing health care of patients. The team is responsible for providing for all of
					 a patient’s health care needs or taking responsibility for appropriately arranging health care by other qualified health care professionals, including making appropriate referrals.(c) Care is coordinated and integrated across all elements of the complex health care system, including mental health and substance use disorder care, and the patient’s community. Care is facilitated, if available, by registries, information technology, health information exchanges, and other means to ensure that patients receive the indicated care when and where they need and want the care in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner.(d) All of the following quality and safety components:(1) The medical home advocates for its patients to support the attainment of optimal, patient-centered outcomes that are defined by a care planning process driven by a compassionate, robust partnership between providers, the patient, and the patient’s
					 family.(2) Evidence-based medicine and clinical decision support tools guide decisionmaking.(3) Licensed health care providers in the medical practice who accept accountability for continuous quality improvement through voluntary engagement in performance measurement and improvement.(4) Patients actively participate in decisionmaking and feedback is sought to ensure that the patients’ expectations are being met.(5) Information technology is utilized appropriately to support optimal patient care, performance measurement, patient education, and enhanced communication.(6) The medical home participates in a voluntary recognition process conducted by an appropriate nongovernmental entity to demonstrate that the practice has the capabilities to provide patient-centered services consistent with the medical home model.(7) Patients and families
					 participate in quality improvement activities at the practice level.(e) Enhanced access to health care is available through systems such as open scheduling, expanded hours, and new options for communication between the patient, the patient’s personal provider, and practice staff.1596.58.24303. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to do any of the following:(a) Permit a medical home to engage in or otherwise aid and abet in the unlicensed practice of medicine, either directly or indirectly.(b) Change the scope of practice of physicians and surgeons, nurse practitioners, or other health care providers.(c) Affect the ability of a nurse to operate under standard procedures pursuant to Section 2725 of the Business and Professions Code.(d) Apply to activities of managed care plans, or their contracting providers, or county alternative models of

					 practice.SEC. 2. This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect.
