						LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1355, Fong.
											  County employees’ retirement: survivor’s allowances.The County Employees Retirement Law of 1937 (CERL) authorizes a county to provide specified optional survivor’s allowances to members who receive retirement benefits pursuant to both CERL and federal social security on a nonintegrated basis. CERL provides that these survivor’s allowances shall be calculated according to one of 2 alternative methods.This bill would appropriately cross-reference an alternative method of calculating survivor’s allowances, as described above. The bill would also make technical changes.Digest Key
