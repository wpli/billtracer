						LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1406, Emmerson.
											  County board of retirement: San Bernardino County.The County Employees Retirement Law of 1937 authorizes the board of retirement of San Bernardino County, upon resolution by the board of retirement, to appoint specified management, investment, and legal personnel. These appointees are not classified as county employees and are therefore not subject to the civil service system, but are employees of that retirement system, subject to the terms of employment determined by the board of retirement.This bill would enact similar provisions to extend the authority of the board of retirement in San Bernardino County, upon adoption by resolution, to appoint specified personnel outside the civil service system, including supervisors and employees with specialized training and knowledge in pension benefit member services, investment reporting compliance, investment accounting, pension benefit tax reporting, pension benefit financial accounting, pension law, and legal counsel. The
		bill would make a conforming change.Digest Key
