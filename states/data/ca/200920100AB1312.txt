						SwansonFebruary 27, 2009 An act to amend Section 104113 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to defibrillators. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1312, Swanson.
											  Defibrillators.Existing law, until July 1, 2012, requires every health studio, as defined, to acquire an automatic external defibrillator, provides immunity for use or nonuse of the devices, except as specified, and establishes standards for the devices, including, but not limited to, maintenance and staff training regarding proper use.This bill would extend the requirements to acquire an automatic external defibrillator to July 1, 2014, however, the immunity provisions and the standards governing the maintenance of the device and the training of personnel in the use of the device would remain in effect after that date if the
		entities that are subject to the bill elect to continue the installation of the device, as specified. The bill would require that records of a readiness check on a defibrillator be maintained for 2 years after the check. The bill would also, beginning July 1, 2010, apply these requirements and this immunity to golf courses and amusement parks, as defined.Digest Key
