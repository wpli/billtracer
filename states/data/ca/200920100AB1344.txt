						FletcherFebruary 27, 2009 An act to amend Section 107.4 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to taxation. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1344, as amended, Fletcher.
											  Taxation: military housing.Existing property tax law requires that all property subject to tax be assessed at its full value, and includes certain possessory interests among those property interests that are subject to tax. Existing property tax law defines a taxable possessory interest to be a use that is independent, durable, and exclusive. Existing property tax law specifies that, for purposes of the definition of a taxable possessory interest, a possession or use is not independent if it is pursuant to a contract that includes, but is not limited to, a long-term lease for the private construction, renovation, rehabilitation, replacement, management, or maintenance of housing for active duty military personnel and their dependents, if the housing units and the private contractor constructing the housing meet specified criteria. Existing law specifies that one of these criteria is a requirement that any reduction, as specified, in property taxes on leased property used for military
		housing, as defined, inures solely to the benefit of the residents of the military housing through improvements. This bill would clarify that, for the purpose of the definition of a taxable possessory interest, any reduction, as specified, in property taxes and any interest earned on the unexpended property tax savings on leased property used for military housing, as defined, would inure solely to the benefit of the current or future residents of the military housing through current or future improvements, including project serving facilities, as specified, and housing improvements, as specified, provided by the contractor with the approval of the military. This bill would specify that these property tax savings may be used to fund the construction of improvements or to service debt incurred to fund the construction of improvements.
		This bill would require the private contractor to expend the reasonable estimate of property tax savings for an assessment year through the construction of improvements or to service debt incurred to fund the construction of improvements within the period of time the county assessor may make an escape assessment, as specified. This bill would require the period of time to expend the property tax savings, and the period of time to make an escape assessment, to be extended if certain conditions occur, as provided.Digest Key
