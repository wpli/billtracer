											  Vehicles: driving under the influence: repeat offenders.(1) Existing law requires, if a person is convicted of a specified driving-under-the-influence (DUI) offense and the offense occurred within 10 years of 2, or 3 or more prior specified DUI offenses that resulted in a conviction, that the person be punished by enhanced penalties, and that the person’s privilege to operate a motor vehicle be revoked by the Department of Motor Vehicles for a period of 2, 3, 4, or 5 years, as applicable.This bill would delete the 10-year limitation.This bill would authorize require
		the department to permanently revoke the driver’s license of a person who was previously convicted of 3 or more specified DUI offenses.The bill would require that prohibit a person whose driver’s license is permanently revoked by the department under these provisions forfeit his or her vehicle to the state or forfeit any interest in the vehicle, if specified provisions apply and would prohibit that person from registering or owning a vehicle in this state. The bill would prohibit a person in this state from selling, leasing, or lending a vehicle to that person.
		from registering a vehicle in this state. Because a person who violates this prohibition is guilty of a crime, this bill would create a new crime, thereby imposing a state-mandated local program.The bill would also authorize a person who had only 3 convictions of a DUI offense, and whose driver’s license was permanently revoked by the by the department to petition to the court for the reinstatement of his or her privilege to drive after a period of 5 years from the date of his or her last conviction if the person successfully passes a written test and driving test for the license classification and successfully completes a specified alcohol treatment program. The
		bill would require the court to consider 5 specified factors in determinating whether to order the department to reinstate the person’s license.(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.Digest Key

                                YES  Bill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. This act shall be known, and may be cited, as “Melody’s Law.”SEC. 2. Section 23217 of the Vehicle Code is amended to read:23217. The Legislature finds and declares that some repeat offenders of the prohibition against driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, when they are addicted or when they have too much alcohol in their systems, may be escaping the intent of the Legislature to punish the offender with progressively greater severity if the offense is repeated one or more times. This situation may occur when a conviction for a subsequent offense occurs before a conviction is obtained on an earlier offense.The Legislature further finds and declares that the timing of court proceedings should not permit a person to avoid aggravated mandatory minimum penalties for multiple separate offenses. It is the intent of the Legislature to provide that a
				  person be subject to enhanced mandatory minimum penalties for multiple offenses, regardless of when the convictions for those offenses were obtained.Nothing in this section requires consideration of judgment of conviction in a separate proceeding that is entered after the judgment in the present proceeding, except as it relates to violation of probation.Nothing in this section or the amendments to Section 23540, 23546, 23550, 23560, 23566, 23622, or 23640 made by Chapter 1205 of the Statutes of 1984 affects the penalty for a violation of Section 23152 or 23153 occurring prior to January 1, 1985.SEC. 3.Section 23540 of the Vehicle Code is amended to read:23540.(a)If a person is convicted of a violation of Section 23152 and the person was previously convicted of a separate violation of Section 23103, as specified in Section 23103.5, 23152, or 23153, that resulted in a conviction, that person shall be punished by imprisonment in the county jail for not less than 90 days nor more than one year and by a fine of not less than three hundred ninety dollars ($390) nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000).
