						FeuerFebruary 27, 2009An act to amend Section 14083 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to Medi-Cal.LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1462, Feuer.
											  Medi-Cal: inpatient hospital services contracts.Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low-income persons are provided with health care services.Under existing law, the California Medical Assistance Commission is authorized to negotiate inpatient hospital services contracts binding upon the State Department of Health Care Services. Existing law requires the commission to consider certain factors in negotiating inpatient hospital services contracts. This bill would add graduate medical education programs to the list of factors the commission is required to consider when negotiating inpatient hospital services contracts.This bill would incorporate additional changes in Section 14083 of the Welfare and Institutions Code proposed by AB 366,
		that would become operative only if AB 366 and this bill are both chaptered and become effective on or before January 1, 2010, and this bill is chaptered last. Digest Key
