											  Hazardous waste: source reduction. Hazardous materials: green chemistry and accidental releases.(1) Existing law requires the Department of Toxic Substances Control to establish programs for hazardous waste source reduction.This bill would additionally require the department to establish programs for life cycle toxic reduction to reduce the use, generation, release, or disposal of a chemical of concern as identified by the department during a product life cycle.(2) Existing law imposes certain duties and responsibilities on the former Office of Emergency Services related to hazardous materials release response plans and inventory, and risk management plans required by federal law.This bill would transfer those duties and responsibilities to the Department of Toxic Substances Control. The bill would authorize
		the California Emergency Management Agency to develop materials, such as guidelines and informational pamphlets, to assist businesses and unified program agencies to fulfill their obligations concerning spill and release reporting, area plans, and the consolidated contingency plans.(3) Existing law requires the Secretary for Environmental Protection to implement a unified hazardous waste and hazardous materials management regulatory program. Existing law requires the unified program be developed in close consultation with specified officials.This bill would additionally require the unified program to be developed and implemented in close consultation with the Director of the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment. The bill would require the secretary to oversee and coordinate the development of regulations and policies to ensure a consolidated, coordinated, and consistent unified
		program.The Hazardous Waste Source Reduction and Management Review Act of 1989, among other things, requires the Department of Toxic Substances Control to establish a technical assistance and outreach program to promote implementation of model source reduction measures in priority industry categories. The act requires the department, every two years in a specified work plan, and in consultation with the California Source Reduction Advisory Committee, to select at least 2 priority categories of generators by SIC Code, as defined. For each selected priority industry category, the department is required to implement a cooperative source reduction technical assistance and outreach program to include specified elements.This bill would increase the minimum number of priority categories the department is required to select every 2 years to 3.The bill would include a statement of legislative
		intent to enact legislation regarding expanding the hazardous waste source reduction program and encouraging the availability of safe, nontoxic consumer products by developing standards to allow those products to be certified as such by the state.Digest Key
