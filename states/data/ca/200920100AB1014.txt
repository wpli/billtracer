						GalgianiFebruary 27, 2009An act to amend Section 12804.9 of, and to add Section 12804.11 to, add Section 12804.13 to the Vehicle Code, relating to vehicles. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1014, as amended, Galgiani.
											  Vehicles: driver’s licenses: agricultural endorsement. farmers.(1) Existing law authorizes the Department of Motor Vehicles to issue a restricted class A driver’s license for the operation of a 2-axle vehicle weighing 4,000 pounds or more unladen when towing a livestock trailer exceeding 10,000 pounds, but not exceeding 15,000 pounds gross vehicle weight rating or gross vehicle weight, if specified conditions are met, including that the vehicle is operated by a farmer and is used to transport livestock. A violation of the Vehicle Code generally is an infraction.This bill would authorize the department to issue a class A or class B restricted driver’s license for the operation of a vehicle in the production, harvesting, or transportation of silage by a farmer, employee of the farmer, or contracted employee of the farmer, between one part of a farm and another part of that farm or from
		one farm to another farm, on a highway for a distance not to exceed 20 miles from the point of origin of the trip. The bill would require the department to follow specified federal regulations in issuing those driver’s licenses. The bill would require a licensed California driver applying for one of those driver’s licenses, upon application and every 2 years thereafter, to submit medical information on a form approved by the department. Because a violation of the bill’s provisions would be an infraction, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.(1)Existing law requires an applicant for a driver’s license to submit to an examination appropriate to the class of vehicle the applicant desires to drive. Class B vehicles include, among others, a vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of more than 26,000 pounds. Successful completion of the examination to drive a class B vehicle qualifies the person to operate all vehicles covered under class C. Class C vehicles include, among others, a vehicle with a GVWR of 26,000 pounds or less. A violation of the Vehicle Code generally is an infraction.This bill would revise those provisions to permit certain persons employed by an agricultural business to operate implements of husbandry and farm vehicles with a GVWR of more than 26,000 pounds only if the person obtains and maintains a class A, class B, or class C
		license and an agricultural endorsement issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles, after providing to the department proof of current employment by an agricultural business and evidence of implement of husbandry or farm vehicle operation training. Because a violation of the bill’s provisions would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.Digest Key
