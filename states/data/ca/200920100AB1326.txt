						HuffmanFebruary 27, 2009 An act to amend Section 2142 of the Elections Code, relating to elections. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1326, Huffman.
											  Voter registration: action to compel registration.Under existing law, if a county elections official refuses to register a qualified elector or if a county elections official has not registered a qualified elector who claims to have registered to vote through the Department of Motor Vehicles or another agency pursuant to the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, the elector may file an action in the superior court to compel his or her registration. Existing law prohibits the clerk of the superior court from charging a fee for services related to the action.This bill would additionally authorize a qualified elector, or the county elections official on the elector’s behalf, who claims to have completed an affidavit of registration and deposited that affidavit with a 3rd party with the intent that the 3rd party timely deliver the completed affidavit to the county elections official to bring an action in the superior court to compel registration.Digest Key
