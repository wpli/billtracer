						JonesFebruary 27, 2009 An act to amend Section 1386 of, and to add Article 6.2 (commencing with Section 1385.01) to Chapter 2.2 of Division 2 of, the Health and Safety Code, and to add Article 4.5 (commencing with Section 10181) to Chapter 1 of Part 2 of Division 2 of the Insurance Code, relating to health care coverage, and making an appropriation therefor. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1218, as introduced, Jones.
											  Health care coverage: rate approval.Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975 (Knox-Keene Act), provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care and makes a willful violation of the act a crime. Existing law also provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance and makes the violation of a final order by the Insurance Commissioner relating to rates subject to assessment of a civil penalty and makes the willful violation of specified rate provisions a misdemeanor. Under existing law, no change in premium rates or coverage in a health care service plan or a health insurance policy may become effective without prior written notification of the change to the contractholder or policyholder. Existing law prohibits a plan and insurer during the term of a plan contract or policy from changing the rate of the premium, copayment, coinsurance, or deductible during specified time periods.This bill would, subject to specified exceptions, require approval by the Department of Managed Health Care or the Department of Insurance of an increase in the amount of the premium, copayment, coinsurance obligation, deductible, and other charges under a health care service plan or health insurance policy. The bill would require a plan or insurer to submit to the Department of Managed Health Care or the Department of Insurance, respectively, an application for a rate increase that would be effective on or after January 1, 2011, and would require review of the application in accordance with regulations that each department would be required to adopt no later than January 1, 2011. The bill would subject a rate increase that became effective January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2010, inclusive, to review by the appropriate department.This bill would require each department to notify the public of a rate application and would deem
		the application approved within 60 days of the date of that notice unless certain conditions exist and the department holds a hearing on the application, as specified. The bill would authorize the initiation of, and intervention in, proceedings relating to rate approvals and the award of advocacy fees and costs in those proceedings in specified circumstances. The bill would require the departments to work together in implementation of these provisions, and to take specified actions in order to ensure coordination and consistency in implementation.This bill would authorize each department to assess a charge in connection with its costs associated with a rate application. The bill would direct the deposit of these fees into the respective department’s Health Rate Approval Fund, which would be created by the bill, and would continuously appropriate that revenue to each department, thereby making an appropriation.Because this
		bill would specify that its violation is punishable by criminal sanctions under the Knox-Keene Act and under provisions applicable to insurers, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.Digest Key

In considering whether a rate is excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory, the department shall consider whether the rate mathematically reflects the health care service plan’s investment income and is reasonable in comparison to coverage benefits. The department shall not consider the degree of competition in determining whether a rate is excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory.(b) The department shall review a rate application pursuant to regulations it promulgates to determine reasonable rates for medical expenses and all nonmedical expenses, including the rate of return,
					 surplus, overhead, and administration.1385.03. (a) A health care service plan shall file a complete rate application with the department for a rate increase that will become effective on or after January 1, 2011.(b) The rate application shall be signed by the officers of the health care service plan who exercise the functions of a chief executive and chief financial officer.

A medical expense is any payment to a hospital, physician, or other provider for the provision of medical care or health care services directly to, or for the benefit of, the enrollee.(4) Salary and bonus compensation paid to the 10 highest paid officers and employees of the applicant for the most recent fiscal year.(5) Dollar amounts of shareholder dividends paid, financial or capital disbursements to affiliates, and management agreements and service contracts.(6) A statement setting forth all of the applicant’s nonmedical expenses for the most recent fiscal year, including administration, dividends, rate of return, advertising, and salaries.(7) A line-item report of medical expenses, including aggregate totals paid to hospitals and physicians, and the amount paid by the applicant for the 100 most common medical expenses incurred by enrollees during the previous calendar year.(e) The health care service plan has the
					 burden to provide the department with evidence and documents establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, the application’s compliance with the requirement of this article.(f) Rate applications shall be submitted by the health care service plan electronically, and the department shall post the applications on its Internet Web site within 10 days of the date of their receipt by the department.(g) All information in a rate application and all materials submitted in its support by the applicant shall constitute a public record for purposes of the California Public Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code) except for financial data the disclosure of which would be competitively injurious to the applicant, as determined by the director.1385.04. A rate increase by a health care service plan that became effective during the period January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2010, inclusive, shall be subject to review by the department for compliance with this article.1385.05. (a) The department shall notify the public of any rate application by a health care service plan.(b) If a proposed rate increase is less than 5 percent and the health care service plan’s medical loss ratio during each of its three most recently completed reporting years, as defined by regulations of the department, is at least 88 percent and during any one or two of those three years is less than 90 percent, the application shall be deemed approved by the department 60 days after the date of the public notice provided under subdivision (a).(c) If a proposed rate increase is 5 percent or greater or the health care service plan’s medical loss ratio during any of its three most
					 recently completed reporting years is less than 88 percent, as defined by regulations of the department, the application shall be deemed approved by the department 60 days after the date of the public notice provided under subdivision (a) unless the department conducts a hearing on the application on any of the following grounds:(1) A consumer, or his or her representative, requests a hearing within 45 days of the date of the public notice, and the department grants the request for a hearing.
