						LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1291, Niello.
											  Unclaimed property.Existing law, the Unclaimed Property Law, governs the disposition of unclaimed property, including the escheat of certain property to the state. Those provisions require a person holding funds or other property escheated to the state to report to the Controller certain information regarding the property and the owner.Existing law provides for the escheat to the state of (1) certain deposits or accounts made with a banking organization, together with other specified sums, (2) certain deposits, accounts, investment certificates, or other interests in or deposits made with a financial organization, together with other specified sums, and (3) certain funds held by a business association in specified retirement accounts or plans, when the owner, for more than 3 years, has not taken any of certain actions, except as specified.Existing law requires certain
		entities to make reasonable efforts to notify owners of certain property, by mail, that the property will escheat to the state under specified provisions of law.This bill would allow those entities to notify an owner described above electronically if the owner has consented to electronic notice.Existing law requires the holder of certain property, including certain property held by a banking or financial organization, certain sums held or owing by a business association to shareholders or other specified persons, and tangible property that is held in the ordinary course of the holder’s business, to notify the owner, at prescribed times, of information regarding escheat and to include a form by which the owner may declare an intention to maintain the deposit, account, shares, or other interest. This bill would require that those notices contain certain
		information, and would allow the holder to provide a telephone number or other electronic means to enable the owner to contact the organization in lieu of returning the above-described form to declare the owner’s intent. The bill would authorize the holder to give additional notices, as specified. The bill, commencing January 1, 2011, would require that, at the time a new account is opened with a banking or financial organization, the organization provide a written notice to the person opening the account regarding escheat.Existing law provides that the contents of any safe deposit box or any other safekeeping repository held in this state by a bank, financial organization, or business association escheat to the state if unclaimed by the owner for more than 3 years from the date on which the lease or rental period on the box or other repository expired, or from the date of termination of another specified agreement, whichever occurs last.This bill would require a bank, financial organization, or business association to notify the owner of the contents of a safe deposit box, at either of 2 specified times, regarding escheat, and would specify the contents of the notice. The bill would require that notice to include a form by which the customer may declare an intention to maintain the safe deposit box or other safekeeping repository, and would authorize the bank, financial organization, or business association to impose a service charge for the notice and form. The bill would provide that the contents of a safe deposit box shall not escheat to the state under certain circumstances. The bill would also require a bank, financial organization, or business association to provide a notice regarding escheat to a person opening a new account for a safe deposit box or other safekeeping repository.Existing law requires every person holding funds or other property
		escheated to the state to report to the Controller, as specified. Existing law requires every person filing such a report to pay or deliver to the Controller all escheated property specified in the report within a certain period.This bill would allow the Controller to postpone the date for payment or delivery of the property, and the date for any report required by the above provisions, upon his or her own motion or upon written request by any person required to pay or deliver the property or file a report.Existing law provides that a person who pays or delivers escheated property to the Controller under the above provisions is relieved of all liability to the extent of the value of the property paid or delivered for any claim that then exists or that thereafter may arise.This bill would provide, instead, that a person who pays or delivers escheated
		property to the Controller under the above provisions and who, prior to escheat, if the person’s records contain an address for the apparent owner, which the holder’s records do not disclose to be inaccurate, has made reasonable efforts to notify the owner by mail or electronically that the owner’s property, deposit, account, shares, or other interest will escheat to the state, is relieved of all liability to the extent of the value of the property paid or delivered for any claim that then exists or that thereafter may arise.Existing law requires that any person who fails to report, pay, or deliver unclaimed property within the time prescribed by these provisions, unless that failure is due to reasonable cause, pay to the Controller interest at the rate of 12% per annum on that property or value thereof from the date the property should have been reported, paid, or delivered.This bill would
		require, in addition, that any person who fails to file a report substantially in the time and manner required by specified provisions of law, unless that failure is due to reasonable cause, pay to the Controller interest as described above. The bill would limit the interest payable to the Controller if a holder has failed to file a report in a required manner, but has timely paid or delivered the property to the Controller.This bill would make other related and conforming changes.Digest Key

In lieu of returning the form, the holder may provide a telephone number or other electronic means to enable the owner to contact the holder. With that contact, as evidenced by a memorandum or other record on file with the holder, the account or other device in which the owner’s property is being held shall be deemed to remain currently active and shall recommence the escheat period.

Any payment of unclaimed cash in an amount of at least twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) shall be made by electronic funds transfer pursuant to regulations adopted by the Controller. The Controller may postpone the date for payment or delivery of the property, and the date for any report required by subdivision (b), upon his or her own motion or upon written request by any person required to pay or deliver the property or file a report as required by this section.(b) If a person establishes his or her right to receive any property specified in the report to the satisfaction of the holder before that property has been delivered to the Controller, or it appears that, for any other reason, the property may not be subject to escheat under this chapter, the holder shall not pay or deliver the property to the Controller but shall instead file a report with the Controller, on a form and in a format prescribed or approved by the Controller, containing information pertaining to the property not subject to escheat.(c) Any property not paid or delivered pursuant to subdivision (b) that is later determined by the holder to be subject to escheat under this chapter shall not be subject to the interest provision of Section 1577.(d) The holder of any interest under subdivision (b) of Section 1516 shall deliver a
				  duplicate certificate to the Controller or shall register the securities in uncertificated form in the name of the Controller.

				  is due pursuant to this section, in addition to any other penalty provided by law. Penalties are due at the time of payment. If the Controller finds that a holder’s failure to make payment by an appropriate electronic funds transfer in accordance with the Controller’s procedures is due to reasonable cause and circumstances beyond the holder’s control, and occurred notwithstanding the exercise of ordinary care and in the absence of willful neglect, that holder shall be relieved of the penalties.(h) An electronic funds transfer shall be accomplished by an automated clearinghouse debit, an automated clearinghouse credit, a Federal Reserve Wire Transfer (Fedwire), or by an international funds transfer.

Where reimbursement is sought for a payment made on a negotiable instrument (including a traveler’s check or money order), the holder shall
				  be reimbursed under this subdivision upon filing proof that the instrument was duly presented to him or her and that payment was made thereon to a person who appeared to the holder to be entitled to payment.(c) The holder shall be reimbursed under this section even if he made the payment to a person whose claim against him was barred because of the expiration of any such period of time as those described in Section 1570.(d) Any holder who has delivered personal property, including a certificate of any interest in a business association, to the Controller pursuant to this chapter may reclaim such personal property if still in the possession of the Controller without payment of any fee or other charges upon filing proof that the owner thereof has claimed such personal property from such holder.

The holder shall not be subject to any interest payment if the holder’s failure to report in
				  substantial compliance with the requirements of Section 1530 is due to reasonable cause.
