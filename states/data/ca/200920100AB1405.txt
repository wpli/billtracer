						Pavley, Price, Romero)February 27, 2009An act to add Part 5 (commencing with Section 71420) to Division 34 of the Public Resources Code, relating to climate change.LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1405, De León.
											  California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006: California Climate Change Community Benefits Fund.The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 requires the State Air Resources Board to adopt regulations to require the reporting and verification of emissions of greenhouse gases and to monitor and enforce compliance with the reporting and verification program, and requires the state board to adopt a statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit equivalent to the statewide greenhouse gas emissions level in 1990 to be achieved by 2020. The act requires the state board to adopt rules and regulations in an open public process to achieve the maximum technologically feasible and cost-effective greenhouse gas emission reductions. The act authorizes the state board to include the use of market-based compliance mechanisms. The act authorizes the state board to adopt a schedule of fees to be paid by the sources of greenhouse gas emissions regulated pursuant to the act, and requires the revenues collected pursuant to that fee to be deposited into the Air Pollution
		Control Fund and be available, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for purposes of carrying out the act. This bill would establish the California Climate Change Community Benefits Fund, and would require a minimum of 10% of revenues generated for the state each year from the state sale of compliance instruments for market-based compliance mechanisms pursuant to the act, other than revenues collected for
		administrative purposes, to be deposited into that fund. The moneys in the fund would be used, upon appropriation by the Legislature, in the most impacted and disadvantaged communities, as defined, to fund programs or projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions or mitigate direct health, or environmental, impacts of climate change through competitive grants, loans, or other funding mechanisms. The Secretary for Environmental Protection would be required to administer moneys appropriated from the fund and would be required to establish criteria and procedures, and meet other requirements in connection with implementation, as provided.Digest Key

Moneys may be appropriated for green collar employment opportunities for the most impacted and
					 disadvantaged communities.(c) (1) The Secretary for Environmental Protection, in consultation with the Climate Action Team, shall use a geographic information system-based method, to the extent feasible, to identify the most impacted and disadvantaged communities that qualify for funding using census block or tract level data, to the extent reasonably available.(2) The identification of the most impacted and disadvantaged communities shall be done through an open and public process, no later than six months after a market-based compliance mechanism, as described in Section 38570 of the Health and Safety Code, becomes operative.(3) The identification of the most impacted and disadvantaged communities may be modified periodically in an open and public process.(4) The scientific basis for the identification of the most impacted and disadvantaged communities shall be subject
					 to peer review pursuant to Section 57004 of the Health and Safety Code.71424. (a) The Secretary for Environmental Protection, following an open and public process, shall develop and adopt a report that describes the support structure and framework for the implementation of this part, the types of programs and projects to be funded under this part, the selection and oversight process for the projects and programs to be funded, and the eligibility criteria.

					 plans describing the specific type of programs and projects to be solicited for funding during the two-year period. The report shall be made available to the public on the California Environmental Protection Agency’s Internet Web site.(c) The Secretary for Environmental Protection shall convene a review panel to make recommendations and review the development of policies, plans, and programs as they relate to this part.(d) To the extent practical, existing support structures, frameworks, and programs shall be used to implement this part.
