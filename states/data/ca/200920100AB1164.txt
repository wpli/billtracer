                                NO  Bill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. Section 315 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read:315. (a) For the purpose of determining uniform standards that will be used by healing arts boards in dealing with substance-abusing licensees, there is established in the Department of Consumer Affairs the Substance Abuse Coordination Committee. The committee shall be comprised of the executive officers of the department’s healing arts boards established pursuant to Division 2 (commencing with Section 500), the State Board of Chiropractic Examiners, the Osteopathic Medical Board of California, and a designee of the State Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs. The Director of Consumer Affairs shall chair the committee and may invite individuals or stakeholders who have particular expertise in the area of substance abuse to advise the committee.(b) The committee shall be subject to the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act (Article 9 (commencing with Section 11120) of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code).(c) By January 1, 2010, the committee shall formulate uniform and specific standards in each of the following areas that each healing arts board shall use in dealing with substance-abusing licensees, whether or not a board chooses to have a formal diversion program:(1) Specific requirements for a clinical diagnostic evaluation of the licensee, including, but not limited to, required qualifications for the providers evaluating the licensee.(2) Specific requirements for the temporary removal of the licensee from practice, in order to enable the licensee to undergo the clinical diagnostic
				  evaluation described in paragraph (1) and any treatment recommended by the evaluator described in paragraph (1) and approved by the board, and specific criteria that the licensee must meet before being permitted to return to practice on a full-time or part-time basis.(3) Specific requirements that govern the ability of the licensing board to communicate with the licensee’s employer about the licensee’s status and condition.(4) Standards governing all aspects of required testing, including, but not limited to, frequency of testing, randomness, method of notice to the licensee, number of hours between the provision of notice and the test, standards for specimen collectors, procedures used by specimen collectors, the permissible locations of testing, whether the collection process must be observed by the collector, backup testing requirements when the licensee is on vacation or
				  otherwise unavailable for local testing, requirements for the laboratory that analyzes the specimens, and the required maximum timeframe from the test to the receipt of the result of the test.(5) Standards governing all aspects of group meeting attendance requirements, including, but not limited to, required qualifications for group meeting facilitators, frequency of required meeting attendance, and methods of documenting and reporting attendance or nonattendance by licensees.(6) Standards used in determining whether inpatient, outpatient, or other type of treatment is necessary.(7) Worksite monitoring requirements and standards, including, but not limited to, required qualifications of worksite monitors, required methods of monitoring by worksite monitors, and required reporting by worksite monitors.(8) Procedures to be followed when a licensee tests positive for a banned substance.(9) Procedures to be followed when a licensee is confirmed to have ingested a banned substance.(10) Specific consequences for major violations and minor violations. In particular, the committee shall consider the use of a “deferred prosecution” stipulation similar to the stipulation described in Section 1000 of the Penal Code, in which the licensee admits to self-abuse of drugs or alcohol and surrenders his or her license. That agreement is deferred by the agency unless or until the licensee commits a major violation, in which case it is revived and the license is surrendered.(11) Criteria that a licensee must meet in order to petition for return to practice on a
				  full-time basis.(12) Criteria that a licensee must meet in order to petition for reinstatement of a full and unrestricted license.(13) If a board uses a private-sector vendor that provides diversion services, standards for immediate reporting by the vendor to the board of any and all noncompliance with any term of the diversion contract or probation; standards for the vendor’s approval process for providers or contractors that provide diversion services, including, but not limited to, specimen collectors, group meeting facilitators, and worksite monitors; standards requiring the vendor to disapprove and discontinue the use of providers or contractors that fail to provide effective or timely diversion services; and standards for a licensee’s termination from the program and referral to enforcement.(14) If a board
				  uses a private-sector vendor that provides diversion services, the extent to which licensee participation in that program shall be kept confidential from the public.(15) If a board uses a private-sector vendor that provides diversion services, a schedule for external independent audits of the vendor’s performance in adhering to the standards adopted by the committee.(16) Measurable criteria and standards to determine whether each board’s method of dealing with substance-abusing licensees protects patients from harm and is effective in assisting its licensees in recovering from substance abuse in the long term.SEC. 2. Section 650 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read:650. (a) Except as provided in Chapter 2.3 (commencing with Section 1400) of Division 2 of the Health and Safety Code, the offer, delivery, receipt, or acceptance by any person licensed under this division or the Chiropractic Initiative Act of any rebate, refund, commission, preference, patronage dividend, discount, or other consideration, whether in the form of money or otherwise, as compensation or inducement for referring patients, clients, or customers to any person, irrespective of any membership, proprietary interest, or coownership in or with any person to whom these patients, clients, or customers are referred is unlawful.(b) The payment or receipt of consideration for services other than the referral of patients which is
				  based on a percentage of gross revenue or similar type of contractual arrangement shall not be unlawful if the consideration is commensurate with the value of the services furnished or with the fair rental value of any premises or equipment leased or provided by the recipient to the payer.(c) The offer, delivery, receipt, or acceptance of any consideration between a federally qualified health center, as defined in Section 1396d(l)(2)(B) of Title 42 of the United States Code, and any individual or entity providing goods, items, services, donations, loans, or a combination thereof to the health center entity pursuant to a contract, lease, grant, loan, or other agreement, if that agreement contributes to the ability of the health center entity to maintain or increase the availability, or enhance the quality, of services provided to a medically underserved population served by the health center, shall be permitted only to the extent sanctioned or
				  permitted by federal law.(d) Except as provided in Chapter 2.3 (commencing with Section 1400) of Division 2 of the Health and Safety Code and in Sections 654.1 and 654.2 of this code, it shall not be unlawful for any person licensed under this division to refer a person to any laboratory, pharmacy, clinic (including entities exempt from licensure pursuant to Section 1206 of the Health and Safety Code), or health care facility solely because the licensee has a proprietary interest or coownership in the laboratory, pharmacy, clinic, or health care facility, provided, however, that the licensee’s return on investment for that proprietary interest or coownership shall be based upon the amount of the capital investment or proportional ownership of the licensee which ownership interest is not based on the number or value of any patients referred. Any referral excepted under this section shall be unlawful if the prosecutor proves that there was no
				  valid medical need for the referral.(e) Except as provided in Chapter 2.3 (commencing with Section 1400) of Division 2 of the Health and Safety Code and in Sections 654.1 and 654.2 of this code, it shall not be unlawful to provide nonmonetary remuneration, in the form of hardware, software, or information technology and training services, as described in subsections (x) and (y) of Section 1001.952 of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as amended October 4, 2007, as published in the Federal Register (72 Fed. Reg. 56632 and 56644), and subsequently amended versions.(f) “Health care facility” means a general acute care hospital, acute psychiatric hospital, skilled nursing facility, intermediate care facility, and any other health facility licensed by the State Department of Public Health under Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 1250) of Division 2 of the Health and Safety
				  Code.(g) A violation of this section is a public offense and is punishable upon a first conviction by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year, or by imprisonment in the state prison, or by a fine not exceeding fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), or by both that imprisonment and fine. A second or subsequent conviction is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison or by imprisonment in the state prison and a fine of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000).SEC. 3. Section 809 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read:809. (a) The Legislature hereby finds and declares the following:(1) In 1986, Congress enacted the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986 (42 U.S.C. Sec. 11101 et seq.), to encourage physicians to engage in effective professional peer review, but giving each state the opportunity to “opt-out” of some of the provisions of the federal act.(2) Because of deficiencies in the federal act and the possible adverse interpretations by the courts of the federal act, it is preferable for California to “opt-out” of the federal act and design its own peer review system.(3) Peer review, fairly conducted, is
				  essential to preserving the highest standards of medical practice.(4) Peer review that is not conducted fairly results in harm to both patients and healing arts practitioners by limiting access to care.(5) Peer review, fairly conducted, will aid the appropriate state licensing boards in their responsibility to regulate and discipline errant healing arts practitioners.(6) To protect the health and welfare of the people of California, it is the policy of the State of California to exclude, through the peer review mechanism as provided for by California law, those healing arts practitioners who provide substandard care or who engage in professional misconduct, regardless of the effect of that exclusion on competition.(7) It is the intent of the
				  Legislature that peer review of professional health care services be done efficiently, on an ongoing basis, and with an emphasis on early detection of potential quality problems and resolutions through informal educational interventions.(8) Sections 809 to 809.8, inclusive, shall not affect the respective responsibilities of the organized medical staff or the governing body of an acute care hospital with respect to peer review in the acute care hospital setting. It is the intent of the Legislature that written provisions implementing Sections 809 to 809.8, inclusive, in the acute care hospital setting shall be included in medical staff bylaws that shall be adopted by a vote of the members of the organized medical staff and shall be subject to governing body approval, which approval shall not be withheld unreasonably.(9) (A) The Legislature thus finds and
				  declares that the laws of this state pertaining to the peer review of healing arts practitioners shall apply in lieu of Section 11101 and following of Title 42 of the United States Code, because the laws of this state provide a more careful articulation of the protections for both those undertaking peer review activity and those subject to review, and better integrate public and private systems of peer review. Therefore, California exercises its right to opt out of specified provisions of the Health Care Quality Improvement Act relating to professional review actions, pursuant to Section 11111(c)(2)(B) of Title 42 of the United States Code. This election shall not affect the availability of any immunity under California law.(B) The Legislature further declares that it is not the intent or purpose of Sections 809 to 809.8, inclusive, to opt out of any mandatory national data bank established pursuant to Section 11131 and following of Title 42
				  of the United States Code.(b) For the purpose of this section and Sections 809.1 to 809.8, inclusive, “healing arts practitioner” or “licentiate” means a physician and surgeon, podiatrist, clinical psychologist, marriage and family therapist, clinical social worker, or dentist; and “peer review body” means a peer review body as specified in paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 805, and includes any designee of the peer review body.SEC. 4. Section 1627.5 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read:1627.5. (a) No person licensed under this chapter, who in good faith renders emergency care at the scene of an emergency occurring outside the place of that person’s practice, or who, upon the request of another person so licensed, renders emergency care to a person for a complication arising from prior care of another person so licensed, shall be liable for any civil damages as a result of any acts or omissions by that person in rendering the emergency care.(b) A person licensed under this chapter who voluntarily and without compensation or expectation of compensation, and consistent with the dental education and emergency training that he or she has received, provides emergency medical care to a person during a state of emergency
				  declared pursuant to a proclamation issued pursuant to Section 8588, 8625, or 8630 of the Government Code or a declaration of health emergency issued pursuant to Section 101080 of the Health and Safety Code shall not be liable in negligence for any personal injury, wrongful death, or property damage caused by the licensee’s good faith but negligent act or omission. This subdivision shall not provide immunity for acts or omissions of gross negligence or willful misconduct. This subdivision does not limit any immunity provided under subdivision (a).(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for the duration of a declared state of emergency, pursuant to a proclamation of emergency issued pursuant to Section 8625 of the Government Code, the board may suspend compliance with any provision of this chapter or regulation adopted thereunder that would adversely affect a licensee’s ability to provide emergency
				  services.SEC. 5. Section 1754.5 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read:1754.5. As used in this article, the following definitions shall apply:(a) “Clinical instruction” means instruction in which students receive supervised experience in performing procedures in a clinical setting on patients. Clinical instruction shall only be performed upon successful demonstration and evaluation of preclinical skills. There shall be at least one instructor for every six students who are simultaneously engaged in clinical instruction.(b) “Didactic instruction” means lectures, demonstrations, and other instruction without active participation by students. The approved provider or its designee may provide didactic instruction via electronic media, home study materials, or
				  live lecture methodology if the provider has submitted that content for approval.(c) “Laboratory instruction” means instruction in which students receive supervised experience performing procedures using study models, mannequins, or other simulation methods. There shall be at least one instructor for every 14 students who are simultaneously engaged in laboratory instruction.(d) “Preclinical instruction” means instruction in which students receive supervised experience performing procedures on students, faculty, or staff members. There shall be at least one instructor for every six students who are simultaneously engaged in preclinical instruction.(e) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2011, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before
				  January 1, 2011, deletes or extends that date.SEC. 6. Section 1915 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read:1915. No person other than a registered dental hygienist, registered dental hygienist in alternative functions, or registered dental hygienist in extended functions or a licensed dentist may engage in the practice of dental hygiene or perform dental hygiene procedures on patients, including, but not limited to, supragingival and subgingival scaling, dental hygiene assessment, and treatment planning, except for the following persons:(a) A student enrolled in a dental or a dental hygiene school who is performing procedures as part of the regular curriculum of that program under the supervision of the faculty of that program.(b) A dental assistant acting in accordance with the rules of the

The renter’s receipt of the oral disclosure shall be demonstrated through the renter’s acknowledging receipt of the oral disclosure near that part of the contract where the renter indicates, by
				  the renter’s own initials, his or her acceptance or declination of the damage waiver. Adjacent to that same part, the contract also shall state that the damage waiver is optional. Further, the contract for these renters shall include a clear and conspicuous written disclosure that the damage waiver may be duplicative of coverage that the customer maintains under his or her own policy of motor vehicle insurance.(3) The following is an example, for purposes of illustration and not limitation, of a notice fulfilling the requirements of paragraph (1) for a rental company that imposes liability on the renter for collision damage to the full value of the vehicle: “NOTICE ABOUT YOUR FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND OPTIONAL DAMAGE WAIVERYou are responsible for all collision damage to the rented vehicle even if someone else caused it or the cause is
				  unknown. You are responsible for the cost of repair up to the value of the vehicle, and towing, storage, and impound fees.Your own insurance, or the issuer of the credit card you use to pay for the car rental transaction, may cover all or part of your financial responsibility for the rented vehicle. You should check with your insurance company, or credit card issuer, to find out about your coverage and the amount of the deductible, if any, for which you may be liable.Further, if you use a credit card that provides coverage for your potential liability, you should check with the issuer to determine if you must first exhaust the coverage limits of your own insurance before the credit card coverage applies.The rental company will not hold you responsible if you buy a damage waiver. But a damage waiver will not protect you if (list exceptions).”(A) When the above notice is printed in the rental contract or holder in which the contract is placed, the following shall be printed immediately following the notice:“The cost of an optional damage waiver is $____ for every (day or week).”(B) When the above notice appears on a sign, the following shall appear immediately adjacent to the notice:“The cost of an optional damage waiver is $____ to $____ for every (day or week), depending upon the vehicle rented.”(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a rental company may sell a damage waiver subject to the following rate limitations for each full or partial 24-hour rental day for the damage waiver.(1) For rental vehicles that the rental company designates as an “economy car,” “subcompact car,” “compact car,” or another term having similar meaning when offered for rental, or another vehicle having a manufacturer’s suggested retail price of nineteen thousand dollars ($19,000) or less, the rate shall not exceed nine dollars ($9).(2) For rental vehicles that have a manufacturer’s suggested retail price from nineteen thousand one dollars ($19,001) to thirty-four thousand nine hundred ninety-nine dollars ($34,999), inclusive, and that are also either vehicles of next year’s model, or not older than the previous year’s model, the rate shall not exceed fifteen dollars ($15). For those rental vehicles older than the previous year’s model-year, the rate shall not exceed nine dollars ($9).(i) The manufacturer’s suggested retail prices described in subdivision (h) shall
				  be adjusted annually to reflect changes from the previous year in the Consumer Price Index. For the purposes of this section, “Consumer Price Index” means the United States Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, for all items.(j) A rental company that disseminates in this state an advertisement containing a rental rate shall include in that advertisement a clearly readable statement of the charge for a damage waiver and a statement that a damage waiver is optional.(k) (1) A rental company shall not require the purchase of a damage waiver, optional insurance, or another optional good or service.(2) A rental company shall not engage in any unfair, deceptive, or coercive conduct to induce a renter to purchase the damage waiver, optional insurance, or another optional good or service,
				  including conduct such as, but not limited to, refusing to honor the renter’s reservation, limiting the availability of vehicles, requiring a deposit, or debiting or blocking the renter’s credit card account for a sum equivalent to a deposit if the renter declines to purchase the damage waiver, optional insurance, or another optional good or service.(l) (1) In the absence of express permission granted by the renter subsequent to damage to, or loss of, the vehicle, a rental company shall not seek to recover any portion of a claim arising out of damage to, or loss of, the rented vehicle by processing a credit card charge or causing a debit or block to be placed on the renter’s credit card account.(2) A rental company shall not engage in any unfair, deceptive, or coercive tactics in attempting to recover or in recovering on any claim arising out of damage to,
				  or loss of, the rented vehicle.(m) (1) A customer facility charge may be collected by a rental company under the following circumstances:(A) Collection of the fee by the rental company is required by an airport operated by a city, a county, a city and county, a joint powers authority, a special district, or the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority formed pursuant to Division 17 (commencing with Section 170000) of the Public Utilities Code.(B) The fee is calculated on a per-contract basis.(C) The fee is a user fee, not a tax imposed upon real property or an incidence of property ownership under Article XIII D of the California Constitution.(D) Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (E), the fee shall be ten dollars ($10) per contract.(E) If the fee imposed by the airport is for both a consolidated rental car facility and a common-use transportation system, the fee collected from customers of on-airport rental car companies shall be ten dollars ($10), but the fee imposed on customers of off-airport rental car companies who are transported on the common-use transportation system is proportionate to the costs of the common-use transportation system only. The fee is uniformly applied to each class of on-airport or off-airport customers, provided that the airport requires off-airport customers to use the common-use transportation system.(F) Revenues collected from the fee do not exceed the reasonable costs of financing, designing, constructing, or operating the facility or transportation services and
				  shall not be used for any other purpose.(G) The fee is separately identified on the rental agreement.(H) This paragraph does not apply to airports the fees of which are governed by Section 50474.1 of the Government Code or Section 57.5 of the San Diego Unified Port District Act.(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, including, but not limited to, Part 1 (commencing with Section 6001) to Part 1.7 (commencing with Section 7280), inclusive, of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, the fees collected pursuant to this section, or another law whereby a local agency operating an airport requires a rental car company to collect a facility financing fee from its customers, are not subject to sales, use, or transaction taxes.(n) (1) A rental company shall only advertise, quote, and charge a rental rate that includes the entire amount except taxes, a customer facility charge, if any, and a mileage charge, if any, that a renter must pay to hire or lease the vehicle for the period of time to which the rental rate applies. A rental company shall not charge in addition to the rental rate, taxes, a customer facility charge, if any, and a mileage charge, if any, any fee that is required to be paid by the renter as a condition of hiring or leasing the vehicle, including, but not limited to, required fuel or airport surcharges other than customer facility charges, nor a fee for transporting the renter to the location where the rented vehicle will be delivered to the renter.(2) In addition to the rental rate, taxes, customer facility charges, if any, and mileage charges, if any, a rental company may charge for an item or service provided
				  in connection with a particular rental transaction if the renter could have avoided incurring the charge by choosing not to obtain or utilize the optional item or service. Items and services for which the rental company may impose an additional charge include, but are not limited to, optional insurance and accessories requested by the renter, service charges incident to the renter’s optional return of the vehicle to a location other than the location where the vehicle was hired or leased, and charges for refueling the vehicle at the conclusion of the rental transaction in the event the renter did not return the vehicle with as much fuel as was in the fuel tank at the beginning of the rental. A rental company also may impose an additional charge based on reasonable age criteria established by the rental company.(3) A rental company shall not charge a fee for authorized drivers in addition to the rental charge for an individual renter.(4) If a rental company states a rental rate in print advertisement or in a telephonic, in-person, or computer-transmitted quotation, the rental company shall disclose clearly in that advertisement or quotation the terms of mileage conditions relating to the advertised or quoted rental rate, including, but not limited to, to the extent applicable, the amount of mileage and gas charges, the number of miles for which no charges will be imposed, and a description of geographic driving limitations within the United States and Canada.(5) (A) When a rental rate is stated in an advertisement, quotation, or reservation in connection with a car rental at an airport where a customer facility charge is imposed, the rental company shall disclose clearly the existence and amount of the customer facility charge. For purposes of this subparagraph, advertisements include
				  radio, television, other electronic media, and print advertisements. For purposes of this subparagraph, quotations and reservations include those that are telephonic, in-person, and computer-transmitted. If the rate advertisement is intended to include transactions at more than one airport imposing a customer facility charge, a range of fees may be stated in the advertisement. However, all rate advertisements that include car rentals at airport destinations shall clearly and conspicuously include a toll-free telephone number whereby a customer can be told the specific amount of the customer facility charge to which the customer will be obligated.(B) If a person or entity other than a rental car company, including a passenger carrier or a seller of travel services, advertises or quotes a rate for a car rental at an airport where a customer facility charge is imposed, that person or entity shall, provided that he, she, or it is provided with
				  information about the existence and amount of the fee, to the extent not specifically prohibited by federal law, clearly disclose the existence and amount of the fee in any telephonic, in-person, or computer-transmitted quotation at the time of making an initial quotation of a rental rate and at the time of making a reservation of a rental car. If a rental car company provides the person or entity with rate and customer facility charge information, the rental car company is not responsible for the failure of that person or entity to comply with this subparagraph when quoting or confirming a rate to a third person or entity.(6) If a rental company delivers a vehicle to a renter at a location other than the location where the rental company normally carries on its business, the rental company shall not charge the renter an amount for the rental for the period before the delivery of the vehicle. If a rental company picks up a rented vehicle from
				  a renter at a location other than the location where the rental company normally carries on its business, the rental company shall not charge the renter an amount for the rental for the period after the renter notifies the rental company to pick up the vehicle.(o) A rental company shall not use, access, or obtain any information relating to the renter’s use of the rental vehicle that was obtained using electronic surveillance technology, except in the following circumstances:(1) (A) When the equipment is used by the rental company only for the purpose of locating a stolen, abandoned, or missing rental vehicle after one of the following:(i) The renter or law enforcement has informed the rental company that the vehicle is missing or has been stolen or abandoned.(ii) The rental vehicle has not been returned following one week after the contracted return date, or by one week following the end of an extension of that return date.(iii) The rental company discovers the rental vehicle has been stolen or abandoned, and, if stolen, it shall report the vehicle stolen to law enforcement by filing a stolen vehicle report, unless law enforcement has already informed the rental company that the vehicle is missing or has been stolen or abandoned.(B) If electronic surveillance technology is activated pursuant to subparagraph (A), a rental company shall maintain a record, in either electronic or written form, of information relevant to the activation of that technology. That information shall include the rental agreement, including the return date, and the date and time the electronic
				  surveillance technology was activated. The record shall also include, if relevant, a record of written or other communication with the renter, including communications regarding extensions of the rental, police reports, or other written communication with law enforcement officials. The record shall be maintained for a period of at least 12 months from the time the record is created and shall be made available upon the renter’s request. The rental company shall maintain and furnish explanatory codes necessary to read the record. A rental company shall not be required to maintain a record if electronic surveillance technology is activated to recover a rental vehicle that is stolen or missing at a time other than during a rental period.(2) In response to a specific request from law enforcement pursuant to a subpoena or search warrant.(3) This subdivision does not prohibit a rental
				  company from equipping rental vehicles with GPS-based technology that provides navigation assistance to the occupants of the rental vehicle, if the rental company does not use, access, or obtain information relating to the renter’s use of the rental vehicle that was obtained using that technology, except for the purposes of discovering or repairing a defect in the technology and the information may then be used only for that purpose.(4) This subdivision does not prohibit a rental company from equipping rental vehicles with electronic surveillance technology that allows for the remote locking or unlocking of the vehicle at the request of the renter, if the rental company does not use, access, or obtain information relating to the renter’s use of the rental vehicle that was obtained using that technology, except as necessary to lock or unlock the vehicle.(5) This subdivision does
				  not prohibit a rental company from equipping rental vehicles with electronic surveillance technology that allows the company to provide roadside assistance, such as towing, flat tire, or fuel services, at the request of the renter, if the rental company does not use, access, or obtain information relating to the renter’s use of the rental vehicle that was obtained using that technology except as necessary to provide the requested roadside assistance.(6) This subdivision does not prohibit a rental company from obtaining, accessing, or using information from electronic surveillance technology for the sole purpose of determining the date and time the vehicle is returned to the rental company, and the total mileage driven and the vehicle fuel level of the returned vehicle. This paragraph, however, shall apply only after the renter has returned the vehicle to the rental company, and the information shall only be used for the purpose described in
				  this paragraph.(p) A rental company shall not use electronic surveillance technology to track a renter in order to impose fines or surcharges relating to the renter’s use of the rental vehicle.(q) A renter may bring an action against a rental company for the recovery of damages and appropriate equitable relief for a violation of this section. The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.(r) A rental company that brings an action against a renter for loss due to theft of the vehicle shall bring the action in the county in which the renter resides or, if the renter is not a resident of this state, in the jurisdiction in which the renter resides.(s) A waiver of any of the provisions of this section shall be
				  void and unenforceable as contrary to public policy.(t) (1) A rental company’s disclosure requirements shall be satisfied for renters who are enrolled in the rental company’s membership program if all of the following conditions are met:(A) Prior to the enrollee’s first rental as a participant in the program, the renter receives, in writing, the following:(i) All of the disclosures required by paragraph (1) of subdivision (g), including the terms and conditions of the rental agreement then in effect.(ii) An Internet Web site address, as well as a contact number or address, where the enrollee can learn of changes to the rental agreement or to the laws of this state governing rental agreements since the effective date of the
				  rental company’s most recent restatement of the rental agreement and distribution of that restatement to its members.(B) At the commencement of each rental period, the renter is provided, on the rental record or the folder in which it is inserted, with a printed notice stating that he or she had either previously selected or declined an optional damage waiver and that the renter has the right to change preferences.(C) At the commencement of each rental period, the rental company provides, on the rearview mirror, a hanger on which a statement is printed, in a box, in at least 12-point boldface type, notifying the renter that the collision damage waiver offered by the rental company may be duplicative of coverage that the customer maintains under his or her own policy of motor vehicle insurance.

This evidence may include, but may not be limited to, a conviction within the last five years for the
				  illegal use or possession of a controlled substance. The court shall order the least intrusive method of testing for the illegal use of controlled substances or the habitual or continual abuse of alcohol by either or both parents, the legal custodian, person seeking guardianship, or person seeking visitation in a guardianship. If substance abuse testing is ordered by the court, the testing shall be performed in conformance with procedures and standards established by the United States Department of Health and Human Services for drug testing of federal employees.

A positive test result, even if challenged and upheld, shall not, by itself, constitute grounds for an adverse custody or guardianship decision. Determining the best interests of the child requires weighing all relevant factors. The
				  court shall also consider any reports provided to the court pursuant to the Probate Code. The results of this testing shall be confidential, shall be maintained as a sealed record in the court file, and may not be released to any person except the court, the parties, their attorneys, the Judicial Council, until completion of its authorized study of the testing process, and any person to whom the court expressly grants access by written order made with prior notice to all parties.

Any breach of the confidentiality of the test results shall be punishable by civil sanctions not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500). The results of the testing may not be used for any purpose, including any criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding, except to assist the court in
				  determining, for purposes of the proceeding, the best interest of the child pursuant to Section 3011 and the content of the order or judgment determining custody or visitation.

For purposes of this section, “surplus state real property” means real property declared surplus by the Legislature and directed to be disposed of by the Department of General Services, including any real property previously declared surplus by the Legislature but not yet disposed of by the Department of General Services prior to the enactment of this section.(b) (1) The department may dispose of surplus state real
				  property by sale, lease, exchange, a sale combined with an exchange, or other manner of disposition of property, as authorized by the Legislature, upon any terms and conditions and subject to any reservations and exceptions the department deems to be in the best interests of the state.(2) (A) The Legislature finds and declares that the provision of decent housing for all Californians is a state goal of the highest priority. The disposal of surplus state real property is a direct and substantial public purpose of statewide concern and will serve an important public purpose, including mitigating the environmental effects of state activities. Therefore, it is the intent of the Legislature that priority be given, as specified in this section, to the disposal of surplus state real property to housing for persons and families of low or moderate income, where land is suitable for housing and there is a need for housing in the
				  community.(B) Surplus state real property that has been determined by the department not to be needed by any state agency shall be offered to any local agency, as defined in subdivision (a) of Section 54221, and then to nonprofit affordable housing sponsors, prior to being offered for sale to private entities or individuals. As used in this subdivision, “nonprofit affordable housing sponsor” means any of the following:(i) A nonprofit corporation incorporated pursuant to Division 2 (commencing with Section 5000) of Title 1 of the Corporations Code.(ii) A cooperative housing corporation which is a stock cooperative, as defined by Section 11003.2 of the Business and Professions Code.(iii) A limited-dividend housing corporation.(C) The department, subject to this section, shall maintain a list of surplus state real property in a conspicuous place on its Internet Web site. The department shall provide local agencies and, upon request, members of the public, with electronic notification of updates to the list of properties.(D) To be considered as a potential priority buyer of the surplus state real property, a local agency or nonprofit affordable housing sponsor shall notify the department of its interest in the surplus state real property within 90 days of the department posting on its Internet Web site the notice of the availability of the surplus state real property. The local agency or nonprofit affordable housing sponsor shall demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the department, that the surplus state real property, or portion of that surplus state real property, is to be used by the local agency or
				  nonprofit affordable housing sponsor for open space, public parks, affordable housing projects, or development of local government-owned facilities. When more than one local agency expresses an interest in the surplus state real property, priority shall be given to the local agency that intends to use the surplus state real property for affordable housing. If no agreement or transfer of title occurs, the priority shall next be given to the local agency that intends to use the surplus state real property for open space, public parks, or development of local government-owned facilities. The sales agreement shall be executed by the local agency or nonprofit affordable housing sponsor within 60 days after the director determines the local agency or nonprofit affordable housing sponsor is to receive the surplus state real property. The sale of the surplus state real property to a local agency or nonprofit affordable housing sponsor pursuant to this section shall be completed, and title transferred, within 60 days
				  of the date the department executes the sales agreement, or, if required by law, no later than 60 days after the State Public Works Board has authorized the sale. If the sale of a surplus state real property to a local agency or nonprofit affordable housing sponsor is not completed within the timeframe specified in this subparagraph, then the department shall proceed with the process for disposal to other private entities or individuals.(c) (1) If more than one local agency desires the surplus state real property for use as an open space, a public park, or the development of a local government-owned facility, the department shall transfer the surplus state real property to the local agency offering the highest price above fair market value. If more than one local agency desires the surplus state real property for use as an affordable housing project, the department shall transfer the surplus state real property to the
				  local agency offering the greatest number of affordable housing units. If more than one nonprofit affordable housing sponsor desires the surplus state real property for use as an affordable housing project, the department shall transfer the surplus state real property to the nonprofit affordable housing sponsor offering the greatest number of affordable housing units.(2) If no local agency or nonprofit affordable housing sponsor is interested, or an agreement, as provided above, is not reached, then the disposal of the surplus state real property to private entities or individuals shall be pursuant to a public bidding process designed to obtain the highest most certain return for the state from a responsible bidder, and any transaction based on such a bidding process shall be deemed to be the fair market value for the purposes of the reporting requirements pursuant to subdivision (d).(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the department may sell surplus state real property, or a portion of surplus state real property, to a local agency, or to a nonprofit affordable housing sponsor if no local agency is interested in the surplus state real property, for affordable housing projects at a sales price less than fair market value if the department determines that such a discount will enable the provision of housing for persons and families of low or moderate income. Nothing shall preclude a local agency that purchases the surplus state real property for affordable housing from reconveying the surplus state real property to a nonprofit affordable housing sponsor for development of affordable housing. Transfer of title to the surplus state real property or lease of the surplus state real property for affordable housing shall be conditioned upon continued use of the surplus state real property as housing for persons and families of low and moderate income for at least 40
				  years and the department shall record a regulatory agreement that imposes affordability covenants, conditions, and restrictions on the surplus state real property. The regulatory agreement shall be a first priority lien on the surplus state real property and last for a period of at least 40 years, and if another state agency is lending funds for a project, a combined regulatory agreement shall be utilized. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the regulatory agreement shall not be subordinated to any other lien or encumbrance except for any federal loan program whose statutes or regulations require a first lien priority for that federal loan.(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Director of General Services may transfer surplus state real property to a local agency for less than fair market value if the local agency uses the surplus state real property for parks or open-space purposes. The deed or other instrument of
				  transfer shall provide that the surplus state real property would revert to the state if the use changed to a use other than parks or open-space purposes during the period of 25 years after the transfer date. For the purpose of this paragraph, “open-space purposes” means the use of land for public recreation, enjoyment of scenic beauty, or conservation or use of natural resources.(d) Thirty days prior to executing a transaction for a sale, lease, exchange, a sale combined with an exchange, or other manner of disposition of the surplus state real property for less than fair market value or for affordable housing, or as authorized by the Legislature, the Director of General Services shall report to the chairpersons of the fiscal committees of the Legislature all of the following:(1) The financial terms of the transaction.(2) A comparison of fair market value for the surplus state real property and the terms listed in paragraph (1).(3) The basis for agreeing to terms and conditions other than fair market value.(e) As to surplus state real property sold and or exchanged pursuant to this section, the director shall except and reserve to the state all mineral deposits, as defined in Section 6407 of the Public Resources Code, together with the right to prospect for, mine, and remove the deposits. If, however, the director determines that there is little or no potential for mineral deposits, the reservation may be without surface right of entry above a depth of 500 feet, or the rights to prospect for, mine, and remove the deposits shall be limited to those areas of the surplus state real property conveyed that the director determines to be reasonably necessary for the removal of the
				  deposits.(f) The failure to comply with this section, except for subdivision (d), shall not invalidate the transfer or conveyance of surplus state real property to a purchaser for value.(g) For purposes of this section, fair market value is established by an appraisal and economic evaluation conducted by the department or approved by the department.SEC. 86. Section 14679 of the Government Code is amended to read:14679. (a) A parking facility under the jurisdiction or control of a state agency, that is available to private persons who desire to conduct business with the state agency, shall reserve for the exclusive use of any vehicle that displays either a special identification license plate issued pursuant to Section 5007 of the Vehicle Code, or a distinguishing placard issued pursuant to Section 22511.55 or 22511.59 of the Vehicle Code, a minimum of one parking space for up to 25 spaces, and additional parking spaces pursuant to Section 1129B of Part 2 of Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations.(1) (A) The space or spaces shall be reserved by posting immediately adjacent to and visible from such space or

				  compliance with subparagraph (B) or (C), is unable to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to achieve the greenhouse gas emission reduction targets established by the state board, the metropolitan planning organization shall prepare an alternative planning strategy to the sustainable communities strategy showing how those greenhouse gas emission targets would be achieved through alternative development patterns, infrastructure, or additional transportation measures or policies. The alternative planning strategy shall be a separate document from the regional transportation plan, but it may be adopted concurrently with the regional transportation plan. In preparing the alternative planning strategy, the metropolitan planning organization:(i) Shall identify the principal impediments to achieving the targets within the sustainable communities strategy.(ii) May include an alternative
				  development pattern for the region pursuant to subparagraphs (B) to (F), inclusive.(iii) Shall describe how the greenhouse gas emission reduction targets would be achieved by the alternative planning strategy, and why the development pattern, measures, and policies in the alternative planning strategy are the most practicable choices for achievement of the greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.(iv) An alternative development pattern set forth in the alternative planning strategy shall comply with Part 450 of Title 23 of, and Part 93 of Title 40 of, the Code of Federal Regulations, except to the extent that compliance will prevent achievement of the greenhouse gas emission reduction targets approved by the state board.(v) For purposes of the California Environmental Quality Act (Division 13 (commencing with
				  Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code), an alternative planning strategy shall not constitute a land use plan, policy, or regulation, and the inconsistency of a project with an alternative planning strategy shall not be a consideration in determining whether a project may have an environmental effect.(I) (i) Prior to starting the public participation process adopted pursuant to subparagraph (E), the metropolitan planning organization shall submit a description to the state board of the technical methodology it intends to use to estimate the greenhouse gas emissions from its sustainable communities strategy and, if appropriate, its alternative planning strategy. The state board shall respond to the metropolitan planning organization in a timely manner with written comments about the technical methodology, including specifically describing any aspects of that methodology it concludes will not yield accurate estimates
				  of greenhouse gas emissions, and suggested remedies. The metropolitan planning organization is encouraged to work with the state board until the state board concludes that the technical methodology operates accurately.(ii) After adoption, a metropolitan planning organization shall submit a sustainable communities strategy or an alternative planning strategy, if one has been adopted, to the state board for review, including the quantification of the greenhouse gas emission reductions the strategy would achieve and a description of the technical methodology used to obtain that result. Review by the state board shall be limited to acceptance or rejection of the metropolitan planning organization’s determination that the strategy submitted would, if implemented, achieve the greenhouse gas emission reduction targets established by the state board. The state board shall complete its review within 60 days.(iii) If the state board determines that the strategy submitted would not, if implemented, achieve the greenhouse gas emission reduction targets, the metropolitan planning organization shall revise its strategy or adopt an alternative planning strategy, if not previously adopted, and submit the strategy for review pursuant to clause (ii). At a minimum, the metropolitan planning organization must obtain state board acceptance that an alternative planning strategy would, if implemented, achieve the greenhouse gas emission reduction targets established for that region by the state board.(J) Neither a sustainable communities strategy nor an alternative planning strategy regulates the use of land, nor, except as provided by subparagraph (I), shall either one be subject to any state approval. Nothing in a sustainable communities strategy shall be interpreted as superseding the exercise of
				  the land use authority of cities and counties within the region. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to limit the state board’s authority under any other provision of law. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to authorize the abrogation of any vested right whether created by statute or by common law. Nothing in this section shall require a city’s or county’s land use policies and regulations, including its general plan, to be consistent with the regional transportation plan or an alternative planning strategy. Nothing in this section requires a metropolitan planning organization to approve a sustainable communities strategy that would be inconsistent with Part 450 of Title 23 of, or Part 93 of Title 40 of, the Code of Federal Regulations and any administrative guidance under those regulations. Nothing in this section relieves a public or private entity or any person from compliance with any other local, state, or federal law.(K) Nothing in this section requires projects programmed for funding on or before December 31, 2011, to be subject to the provisions of this paragraph if they (i) are contained in the 2007 or 2009 Federal Statewide Transportation Improvement Program, (ii) are funded pursuant to Chapter 12.49 (commencing with Section 8879.20) of Division 1 of Title 2, or (iii) were specifically listed in a ballot measure prior to December 31, 2008, approving a sales tax increase for transportation projects. Nothing in this section shall require a transportation sales tax authority to change the funding allocations approved by the voters for categories of transportation projects in a sales tax measure adopted prior to December 31, 2010. For purposes of this subparagraph, a transportation sales tax authority is a district, as defined in Section 7252 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, that is authorized to impose a sales tax for transportation purposes.(L) A metropolitan planning organization, or a regional transportation planning agency not within a metropolitan planning organization, that is required to adopt a regional transportation plan not less than every five years, may elect to adopt the plan not less than every four years.

The participating metropolitan planning organizations may also develop a multiregional sustainable communities strategy, to the extent consistent with federal law, or an alternative planning strategy for adoption by the metropolitan planning organizations. Each participating metropolitan planning
				  organization shall consider any adopted multiregional goals and policies in the development of a sustainable communities strategy and, if applicable, an alternative planning strategy for its region.(3) An action element that describes the programs and actions necessary to implement the plan and assigns implementation responsibilities. The action element may describe all transportation projects proposed for development during the 20-year or greater life of the plan. The action element shall consider congestion management programming activities carried out within the region.(4) (A) A financial element that summarizes the cost of plan implementation constrained by a realistic projection of available revenues. The financial element shall also contain recommendations for allocation of funds. A county transportation commission created pursuant to Section 130000
				  of the Public Utilities Code shall be responsible for recommending projects to be funded with regional improvement funds, if the project is consistent with the regional transportation plan. The first five years of the financial element shall be based on the five-year estimate of funds developed pursuant to Section 14524. The financial element may recommend the development of specified new sources of revenue, consistent with the policy element and action element.(B) The financial element of transportation planning agencies with populations that exceed 200,000 persons may include a project cost breakdown for all projects proposed for development during the 20-year life of the plan that includes total expenditures and related percentages of total expenditures for all of the following:(i) State highway expansion.(ii) State highway rehabilitation, maintenance, and operations.(iii) Local road and street expansion.(iv) Local road and street rehabilitation, maintenance, and operation.(v) Mass transit, commuter rail, and intercity rail expansion.(vi) Mass transit, commuter rail, and intercity rail rehabilitation, maintenance, and operations.(vii) Pedestrian and bicycle facilities.(viii) Environmental enhancements and mitigation.(ix) Research and planning.(x) Other categories.(C) The metropolitan planning organization or county transportation agency, whichever entity is appropriate, shall consider financial incentives for cities and counties that have resource areas or farmland, as defined in Section 65080.01, for the purposes of, for example, transportation investments for the preservation and safety of the city street or county road system and farm to market and interconnectivity transportation needs. The metropolitan planning organization or county transportation agency, whichever entity is appropriate, shall also consider financial assistance for counties to address countywide service responsibilities in counties that contribute toward the greenhouse gas emission reduction targets by implementing policies for growth to occur within their cities.(c) Each transportation planning agency may also include other factors of local significance as an element
				  of the regional transportation plan, including, but not limited to, issues of mobility for specific sectors of the community, including, but not limited to, senior citizens.(d) Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, each transportation planning agency shall adopt and submit, every four years, an updated regional transportation plan to the California Transportation Commission and the Department of Transportation. A transportation planning agency located in a federally designated air quality attainment area or that does not contain an urbanized area may at its option adopt and submit a regional transportation plan every five years. When applicable, the plan shall be consistent with federal planning and programming requirements and shall conform to the regional transportation plan guidelines adopted by the California Transportation Commission. Prior to adoption of the regional transportation plan, a public hearing shall be held after
				  the giving of notice of the hearing by publication in the affected county or counties pursuant to Section 6061.SEC. 89.5. The heading of Article 2.11 (commencing with Section 65892.13) of Chapter 4 of Division 1 of Title 7 of the Government Code is repealed.SEC. 90. Section 66704 of the Government Code is amended to read:66704. The authority has, and may exercise, all powers, expressed or implied, that are necessary to carry out the intent and purposes of this title, including, but not limited to, the power to do all of the following:(a) (1) Levy a benefit assessment, special tax, or property-related fee consistent with the requirements of Articles XIII C and XIII D of the California Constitution, including, but not limited to, a benefit assessment levied pursuant to paragraph (2), except that a benefit assessment, special tax, or property-related fee shall not be levied pursuant to this subdivision after December 31, 2028.(2) The

The association shall have no cause of action against the insureds of the insolvent insurer for any sums it has paid out, except as provided by this article.(c) (1) If damages against uninsured motorists are recoverable by the claimant from his or her own insurer, the applicable limits of the uninsured motorist coverage shall be a credit against a covered claim payable under this article.

				  first-party claim for damage to property with a permanent location, he or she shall seek recovery first from the association of the permanent location of the property, and if it is a workers’ compensation claim, he or she shall seek recovery first from the association of the residence of the claimant. Any recovery under this article shall be reduced by the amount of recovery from any other insurance guaranty association or its equivalent. A member insurer may recover in subrogation from the association only one-half of any amount paid by that insurer under uninsured motorist coverage for bodily injury or wrongful death (and nothing for a payment for anything else), in those cases where the injured person insured by such an insurer has proceeded under his or her uninsured motorist coverage on the ground that the tort-feasor is uninsured as a result of the insolvency of his or her liability insurer (an insolvent insurer as defined in this article), provided that the member insurer shall waive all rights of
				  subrogation against such tort-feasor. Any amount paid a claimant in excess of the amount authorized by this section may be recovered by action, or other proceeding, brought by the association.(2) Any claimant having collision coverage on a loss which is covered by the insolvent company’s liability policy shall first proceed against his or her collision carrier.

				  that person pursuant to this article.(e) Any person having a claim or legal right of recovery under any governmental insurance or guaranty program which is also a covered claim, shall be required to first exhaust his or her right under the program. Any amount payable on a covered claim shall be reduced by the amount of any recovery under the program.(f) “Covered claims” for unearned premium by lenders under insurance premium finance agreements as defined in Section 673 shall be computed as of the earliest cancellation date of the policy pursuant to Section 673 or subdivision (g) of this section.(g) “Covered claims” shall not include any judgments against or obligations or liabilities of the insolvent insurer or the commissioner, as liquidator, or otherwise resulting from alleged or proven torts, nor shall any
				  default judgment or stipulated judgment against the insolvent insurer, or against the insured of the insolvent insurer, be binding against the association.(h) “Covered claims” shall not include any loss adjustment expenses, including adjustment fees and expenses, attorney’s fees and expenses, court costs, interest, and bond premiums, incurred prior to the appointment of a liquidator.SEC. 129. Section 1765 of the Insurance Code is amended to read:1765. (a) A license under this chapter shall be applied for and renewed by the filing with the commissioner of a written application therefor, in accordance with Section 1652.(b) Subject to subdivision (f), the commissioner shall issue a license authorizing any applicant who is trustworthy and competent to transact an insurance brokerage business in a manner as to safeguard the interest of the insured, to act as a surplus line broker from the date of the license until the expiration date specified in Section 1630.(c) An applicant for a surplus line broker’s license shall, as part of the application and a condition of the issuance of the license, file a bond to the

Every applicant for a business entity license, as provided in subdivision (a) of Section 1765.2, shall
				  provide the names of all persons who may exercise the power and perform the duties under the license.

In establishing the baseline quantities, the commission shall take into account climatic and seasonal variations in consumption and the availability of gas service. The commission shall review and revise baseline quantities as average consumption patterns change in order to
				  maintain these ratios.(2) “Residential customer” means those customers receiving electrical or gas service pursuant to a domestic rate schedule and excludes industrial, commercial, and every other category of customer.(b) The commission shall designate a baseline quantity of gas and electricity which is necessary to supply a significant portion of the reasonable energy needs of the average residential customer. In estimating those quantities, the commission shall take into account differentials in energy needs between customers whose residential energy needs are currently supplied by electricity alone or by both electricity and gas. The commission shall develop a separate baseline quantity for all-electric residential customers. For these purposes, “all-electric residential customers” are residential customers having electrical service only or whose space heating is provided by
				  electricity, or both. The commission shall also take into account differentials in energy use by climatic zone and season.(c) (1) The commission shall establish a standard limited allowance which shall be in addition to the baseline quantity of gas and electricity for residential customers dependent on life-support equipment, including, but not limited to, emphysema and pulmonary patients. A residential customer dependent on life-support equipment shall be allocated a higher energy allocation than the average residential customer.(2) “Life-support equipment” means that equipment which utilizes mechanical or artificial means to sustain, restore, or supplant a vital function, or mechanical equipment which is relied upon for mobility both within and outside of buildings. “Life-support equipment,” as used in this subdivision, includes all of the following: all
				  types of respirators, iron lungs, hemodialysis machines, suction machines, electric nerve stimulators, pressure pads and pumps, aerosol tents, electrostatic and ultrasonic nebulizers, compressors, IPPB machines, and motorized wheelchairs.(3) The limited allowance specified in this subdivision shall also be made available to paraplegic and quadriplegic persons in consideration of the increased heating and cooling needs of those persons.(4) The limited allowance specified in this subdivision shall also be made available to multiple sclerosis patients in consideration of the increased heating and cooling needs of those persons.(5) The limited allowance specified in this subdivision shall also be made available to scleroderma patients in consideration of the increased heating needs of those persons.(6) The limited allowance specified in this subdivision shall also be made available to persons who are being treated for a life-threatening illness or have a compromised immune system, if a licensed physician and surgeon or a person licensed pursuant to the Osteopathic Initiative Act certifies in writing to the utility that the additional heating or cooling allowance, or both, is medically necessary to sustain the life of the person or prevent deterioration of the person’s medical condition.(d) (1) The commission shall require that every electrical and gas corporation file a schedule of rates and charges providing baseline rates. The baseline rates shall apply to the first or lowest block of an increasing block rate structure which shall be the baseline quantity. In establishing these rates, the commission shall avoid excessive rate increases for residential
				  customers, and shall establish an appropriate gradual differential between the rates for the respective blocks of usage.(2) In establishing residential electric and gas rates, including baseline rates, the commission shall ensure that the rates are sufficient to enable the electrical corporation or gas corporation to recover a just and reasonable amount of revenue from residential customers as a class, while observing the principle that electricity and gas services are necessities, for which a low affordable rate is desirable and while observing the principle that conservation is desirable in order to maintain an affordable bill.(3) At least until December 31, 2003, the commission shall require that all charges for residential electric customers are volumetric, and shall prohibit any electrical corporation from imposing any charges on residential consumption that are independent
				  of consumption, unless those charges are in place prior to April 12, 2001.(e) (1) Each electrical corporation and each gas corporation shall, in a timeframe consistent with each electrical and gas corporation’s next general rate case, disclose on the billing statement of a residential customer all of the following:(A) Cost per kilowatthour or gas therm per tier.(B) Allocation of kilowatthour or gas therm per tier.(C) Visual representation of usage and cost per tier.(D) Usage comparison with prior periods.(E) Itemized cost components in the bill to identify state and local taxes.(F) Identification of delivery, generation, public purpose, and other charges.(G) Contact information for the commission’s Consumer Affairs Branch.(2) An electrical corporation and a gas corporation shall make available online to residential customers both of the following:(A) Examples of how conservation measures, including changing thermostat settings and turning off unused lights, could reduce energy usage and costs.(B) Examples of how energy-saving devices and weatherization measures could reduce energy usage and costs.(3) The commission may modify, adjust, or add to the requirements of this subdivision as the
				  individual circumstances of each electrical corporation or gas corporation merits, or for master-meter customers, as individual circumstances merit.(4) The commission shall, as part of the general rate case of an electrical corporation or gas corporation, assess opportunities to improve the quality of information contained in the utility’s periodic billings.(f) Wholesale electrical or gas purchases, and the rates charged therefor, are exempt from this section.(g) Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to prohibit experimentation with alternative gas or electrical rate schedules for the purpose of achieving energy conservation.SEC. 164. Section 99171 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to read:99171. (a) (1) A transit district may issue a prohibition order to any person to whom either of the following applies:(A) On at least three separate occasions within a period of 60 consecutive days, the person is cited for an infraction committed in or on a vehicle, bus stop, or light rail station of the transit district for any act that is a violation of paragraph (2) or (5) of subdivision (a) of Section 99170 of this code or paragraph (6), (7), (8), or (9) of subdivision (b) of Section 640 or Section 640.5 of the Penal Code.(B) The person is arrested or convicted for a misdemeanor or felony committed in or on a vehicle, bus stop, or light rail

Upon conviction of a felony offense, the duration of the prohibition order for the conviction, when added to the duration of the prohibition order for the initial arrest, if any, may not exceed one year.(3) No prohibition order issued under this subdivision shall be effective unless the transit district first affords the person an opportunity to contest the transit district’s proposed action in accordance with procedures adopted by the transit district for this purpose. A transit district’s procedures shall provide, at a minimum, for the notice and other protections set forth in
				  subdivisions (b) and (c), and the transit district shall provide reasonable notification to the public of the availability of those procedures.(b) (1) A notice of a prohibition order issued under subdivision (a) shall set forth a description of the conduct underlying the violation or violations giving rise to the prohibition order, including reference to the applicable statutory provision, ordinance, or transit district rule violated, the date of the violation, the approximate time of the violation, the location where the violation occurred, the period of the proposed prohibition, and the scope of the prohibition. The notice shall include a clear and conspicuous statement indicating the procedure for contesting the prohibition order. The notice of prohibition order shall be personally served upon the violator. The notice of prohibition order, or a copy, shall be considered a record kept in the ordinary course of business
				  of the transit district and shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained in the notice establishing a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence. For purposes of this paragraph, “clear and conspicuous” means in larger type than the surrounding text, or in contrasting type, font, or color to the surrounding text of the same size, or set off from the surrounding text of the same size by symbols or other marks that call attention to the language.(2) For purposes of this section, “personal service” means any of the following:(A) In-person delivery.(B) Delivery by any form of mail providing for delivery confirmation, postage prepaid, to at least one address provided by the person being served, including, but not limited to, the address set forth in any citation or in court records.(C) Any alternate method approved in writing by the transit district and the person being served.(3) If a person served with a notice of prohibition order is not able, or refuses, to provide a mailing address, the notice of prohibition order shall set forth the procedure for obtaining any letters, notices, or orders related to the prohibition order from the administrative offices of the transit district. For purposes of this section, delivery shall be deemed to have been made on the following date, as applicable:(A) On the date of delivery, if delivered in person.(B) On the date of confirmed delivery, for any delivery by mail.(C) For any alternate method of service, as provided in the
				  writing specifying the alternate method.(4) Proof of service of the notice shall be filed with the transit district.(5) If a person contests a notice of prohibition order, the transit district shall proceed in accordance with subdivision (c). If the notice of prohibition order is not contested within 10 calendar days after delivery by personal service, the prohibition order shall be deemed final and shall go into effect, without further action by the transit district, for the period of time set forth in the order.(6) All prohibition orders shall be subject to an automatic stay and shall not take effect until the latest of the following:(A) Eleven calendar days after delivery of the prohibition order by personal service.(B) If an initial review is timely requested under paragraph (1) of subdivision (c), 11 calendar days after delivery by personal service of the results of the review.(C) If an administrative hearing is timely requested under paragraph (3) of subdivision (c), the date the hearing officer’s decision is delivered by personal service.(c) (1) For a period of 10 calendar days from the delivery of the prohibition order by personal service, the person may request an initial review of the prohibition order by the transit district. The request may be made by telephone, in writing, or in person. There shall be no charge for this review. In conducting its review and reaching a determination, the transit district shall determine whether the prohibition order meets the requirements of subdivision (a) and,
				  unless the person has been convicted of the offense or offenses, whether the offense or offenses for which the person was cited or arrested are proven by a preponderance of the evidence. If, following the initial review, based on these findings, the transit district determines that the prohibition order is not adequately supported or that extenuating circumstances make dismissal of the prohibition order appropriate in the interest of justice, the transit district shall cancel the notice. If, following the initial review, based on these findings, the transit district determines that the prohibition order should be upheld in whole or in part, the transit district shall issue a written statement to that effect, including any modification to the period or scope of the prohibition order. The transit district shall serve the results of the initial review to the person contesting the notice by personal service.(2) The transit district may modify or
				  cancel a prohibition order in the interest of justice. The transit district shall cancel a prohibition order if it determines that the person did not understand the nature and extent of his or her actions or did not have the ability to control his or her actions. If the person is dependent upon the transit system for trips of necessity, including, but not limited to, travel to or from medical or legal appointments, school or training classes, places of employment, or obtaining food, clothing, and necessary household items, the transit district shall modify a prohibition order to allow for those trips. A person requesting a cancellation or modification in the interest of justice shall have the burden of establishing the qualifying circumstances by a preponderance of the evidence.(3) If the person is dissatisfied with the results of the initial review, the person may request an administrative hearing of the prohibition order no later than 10
				  calendar days after the results of the initial review are delivered by personal service. The request may be made by telephone, in writing, or in person. An administrative hearing shall be held within 30 calendar days after the receipt of a request for an administrative hearing. The person requesting the hearing may request one continuance, not to exceed seven calendar days.(4) The administrative hearing process shall include all of the following:(A) The person requesting the hearing shall have the choice of a hearing by mail or in person. An in-person hearing shall be conducted within the jurisdiction of the transit district.(B) The administrative hearing shall be conducted in accordance with written procedures established by the transit district and approved by the governing body or chief executive officer of the
				  transit district. The hearing shall provide an independent, objective, fair, and impartial review of the prohibition order.(C) The administrative review shall be conducted before a hearing officer designated to conduct the review by the transit district’s governing body or chief executive officer. In addition to any other requirements, a hearing officer shall demonstrate the qualifications, training, and objectivity prescribed by the transit agency’s governing body or chief executive officer as are necessary to fulfill and that are consistent with the duties and responsibilities set forth in this subdivision. The hearing officer’s continued service, performance evaluation, compensation, and benefits, as applicable, shall not be directly or indirectly linked to the number of prohibition orders upheld by the hearing officer.(D) The person who issued the notice of prohibition order
				  shall not be required to participate in an administrative hearing, unless participation is requested by the person requesting the hearing. The request for participation must be made at least five calendar days prior to the date of the hearing and may be made by telephone, in writing, or in person. The notice of prohibition order, in proper form, shall be prima facie evidence of the violation or violations pursuant to subdivision (a) establishing a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence.(E) In issuing a decision, the hearing officer shall determine whether the prohibition order meets the requirements of subdivision (a) and, unless the person has been convicted of the offense or offenses, whether the offense or offenses for which the person was cited or arrested are proven by a preponderance of the evidence. Based upon these findings, the hearing officer may uphold the prohibition order in whole, determine that the
				  prohibition order is not adequately supported, or cancel or modify the prohibition order in the interest of justice. The hearing officer shall cancel a prohibition order if he or she determines that the person did not understand the nature and extent of his or her actions or did not have the ability to control his or her actions. If the person is dependent upon the transit system for trips of necessity, including, but not limited to, travel to or from medical or legal appointments, school or training classes, places of employment, or obtaining food, clothing, and necessary household items, the transit district shall modify a prohibition order to allow for those trips. A person requesting a cancellation or modification in the interest of justice shall have the burden of establishing the qualifying circumstances by a preponderance of the evidence.(F) The hearing officer’s decision following the administrative hearing shall be delivered by
				  personal service.(G) A person aggrieved by the final decision of the hearing officer may seek judicial review of the decision within 90 days of the date of delivery of the decision by personal service, as provided by Section 1094.6 of the Code of Civil Procedure.(d) A person issued a prohibition order under subdivision (a) may, within 10 calendar days of the date the order goes into effect under paragraph (6) of subdivision (b), request a refund for any prepaid fare media rendered unusable in whole or in part by the prohibition order, including, but not limited to, monthly passes. If the fare media remain usable for one or more days outside the period of the prohibition order, the refund shall be prorated based on the number of days the fare media will be unusable. The issuance of a refund may be made contingent on surrender of the fare media.(e) For purposes of this section “transit district” means the Sacramento Regional Transit District or the Fresno Area Express.(f) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2012, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2012, deletes or extends that date.SEC. 165. Section 101223 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to read:101223. The authority to incur indebtedness vested in the district by the provisions of this article shall be in addition to any right vested in it to receive a temporary transfer of funds pursuant to the last paragraph of Section 6 of Article XVI of the California Constitution.SEC. 166. Section 103311 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to read:103311. The district shall have the power to obtain temporary transfers of funds in accordance with the last paragraph of Section 6 of Article XVI of the California Constitution.SEC. 167. Section 120508 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to read:120508. (a) This article also applies to the employee relations of employees of a nonprofit entity that operates public mass transit services and that is solely owned by the board.

				  against the person.(2) This section shall not apply if either of the following conditions is met:(A) A minor requests that his or her parents, guardians, or other persons not be notified, and the director of the division facility, as appropriate, determines it would be in the best interest of the minor not to notify the parents, guardians, or other persons.(B) A person 18 years of age or older does not consent to the notification.(b) Upon intake of a person into a division facility, and again upon attaining 18 years of age while in the custody of the division, an appropriate staff person shall explain, using language clearly understandable to the person, all of the provisions of this section, including that the person has the right to (1) request
				  that the information described in paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) not be provided to a parent or guardian, and (2) request that another person or persons in addition to, or in lieu of, a parent or guardian be notified. The division shall provide the person with forms and any information necessary to provide informed consent as to who shall be notified. Any designation made pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (a), the consent to notify parents, guardians, or other persons, and the withholding of that consent, may be amended or revoked by the person, and shall be transferable among facilities.(c) Staff of the division shall enter the following information into the ward’s record, as appropriate, upon its occurrence:(1) A minor’s request that his or her parents, guardians, or other persons not be notified of an emergency pursuant to this section, and the determination of the

				  illness or injury that requires hospitalization, requires an evaluation for involuntary treatment for a mental health disorder or grave disability under the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act (Part 1 (commencing with Section 5000) of Division 5), is potentially life threatening, or that potentially will permanently impair the use of a major body organ, appendage, or limb.(3) “Suicide attempt” means a self-inflicted destructive act committed with explicit or inferred intent to die.SEC. 186. Section 241.1 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:241.1. (a) Whenever a minor appears to come within the description of both Section 300 and Section 601 or 602, the county probation department and the child welfare services department shall, pursuant to a jointly developed written protocol described in subdivision (b), initially determine which status will serve the best interests of the minor and the protection of society. The recommendations of both departments shall be presented to the juvenile court with the petition that is filed on behalf of the minor, and the court shall determine which status is appropriate for the minor. Any other juvenile court having jurisdiction over the minor shall receive notice from the court, within five calendar days, of the presentation of the recommendations of the departments. The notice shall include the
				  name of the judge to whom, or the courtroom to which, the recommendations were presented.(b) The probation department and the child welfare services department in each county shall jointly develop a written protocol to ensure appropriate local coordination in the assessment of a minor described in subdivision (a), and the development of recommendations by these departments for consideration by the juvenile court. These protocols shall require, but not be limited to, consideration of the nature of the referral, the age of the minor, the prior record of the minor’s parents for child abuse, the prior record of the minor for out-of-control or delinquent behavior, the parents’ cooperation with the minor’s school, the minor’s functioning at school, the nature of the minor’s home environment, and the records of other agencies that have been involved with the minor and his or her family. The protocols also shall contain provisions for resolution of
				  disagreements between the probation and child welfare services departments regarding the need for dependency or ward status and provisions for determining the circumstances under which a new petition should be filed to change the minor’s status.(c) Whenever a minor who is under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court of a county pursuant to Section 300, 601, or 602 is alleged to come within the description of Section 300, 601, or 602 by another county, the county probation department or child welfare services department in the county that has jurisdiction under Section 300, 601, or 602 and the county probation department or child welfare services department of the county alleging the minor to be within one of those sections shall initially determine which status will best serve the best interests of the minor and the protection of society. The recommendations of both departments shall be presented to the juvenile court in which the petition is
				  filed on behalf of the minor, and the court shall determine which status is appropriate for the minor. In making their recommendation to the juvenile court, the departments shall conduct an assessment consistent with the requirements of subdivision (b). Any other juvenile court having jurisdiction over the minor shall receive notice from the court in which the petition is filed within five calendar days of the presentation of the recommendations of the departments. The notice shall include the name of the judge to whom, or the courtroom to which, the recommendations were presented.(d) Except as provided in subdivision (e), nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the filing of a petition or petitions, or the entry of an order by the juvenile court, to make a minor simultaneously both a dependent child and a ward of the court.(e) Notwithstanding subdivision (d),
				  the probation department and the child welfare services department, in consultation with the presiding judge of the juvenile court, in any county may create a jointly written protocol to allow the county probation department and the child welfare services department to jointly assess and produce a recommendation that the child be designated as a dual status child, allowing the child to be simultaneously a dependent child and a ward of the court. This protocol shall be signed by the chief probation officer, the director of the county social services agency, and the presiding judge of the juvenile court prior to its implementation. No juvenile court may order that a child is simultaneously a dependent child and a ward of the court pursuant to this subdivision unless and until the required protocol has been created and entered into. This protocol shall include all of the following:(1) A description of the process to be used to determine whether
				  the child is eligible to be designated as a dual status child.(2) A description of the procedure by which the probation department and the child welfare services department will assess the necessity for dual status for specified children and the process to make joint recommendations for the court’s consideration prior to making a determination under this section. These recommendations shall ensure a seamless transition from wardship to dependency jurisdiction, as appropriate, so that services to the child are not disrupted upon termination of the wardship.(3) A provision for ensuring communication between the judges who hear petitions concerning children for whom dependency jurisdiction has been suspended while they are within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court pursuant to Section 601 or 602. A judge may communicate by providing a copy of any reports filed pursuant to
				  Section 727.2 concerning a ward to a court that has jurisdiction over dependency proceedings concerning the child.(4) A plan to collect data in order to evaluate the protocol pursuant to Section 241.2.(5) Counties that exercise the option provided for in this subdivision shall adopt either an “on-hold” system as described in subparagraph (A) or a “lead court/lead agency” system as described in subparagraph (B). In no case shall there be any simultaneous or duplicative case management or services provided by both the county probation department and the child welfare services department. It is the intent of the Legislature that judges, in cases in which more than one judge is involved, shall not issue conflicting orders.(A) In counties in which an on-hold system is adopted, the dependency jurisdiction shall be
				  suspended or put on hold while the child is subject to jurisdiction as a ward of the court. When it appears that termination of the court’s jurisdiction, as established pursuant to Section 601 or 602, is likely and that reunification of the child with his or her parent or guardian would be detrimental to the child, the county probation department and the child welfare services department shall jointly assess and produce a recommendation for the court regarding whether the court’s dependency jurisdiction shall be resumed.(B) In counties in which a lead court/lead agency system is adopted, the protocol shall include a method for identifying which court or agency will be the lead court/lead agency. That court or agency shall be responsible for case management, conducting statutorily mandated court hearings, and submitting court reports.SEC. 187. Section 391 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:391. (a) At any hearing to terminate jurisdiction over a dependent child who has reached the age of majority, the county welfare department shall do all of the following:(1) Ensure that the child is present in court, unless the child does not wish to appear in court, or document efforts by the county welfare department to locate the child when the child is not available.(2) Submit a report verifying that the following information, documents, and services have been provided to the child:(A) Written information concerning the child’s dependency case, including any known information regarding the child’s
				  Indian heritage or tribal connections, if applicable, his or her family history and placement history, any photographs of the child or his or her family in the possession of the county welfare department, other than forensic photographs, the whereabouts of any siblings under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, unless the court determines that sibling contact would jeopardize the safety or welfare of the sibling, directions on how to access the documents the child is entitled to inspect under Section 827, and the date on which the jurisdiction of the juvenile court would be terminated.(B) The following documents:(i) Social security card.(ii) Certified birth certificate.(iii) Health and education summary, as described in subdivision (a) of Section
				  16010.(iv) Driver’s license, as described in Section 12500 of the Vehicle Code, or identification card, as described in Section 13000 of the Vehicle Code.(v) A letter prepared by the county welfare department that includes the following information:(I) The child’s name and date of birth.(II) The dates during which the child was within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.(III) A statement that the child was a foster youth in compliance with state and federal financial aid documentation requirements.(vi) If applicable, the death certificate of the parent or parents.(vii) If applicable, proof of the child’s citizenship or legal residence.(C) Assistance in completing an application for Medi-Cal or assistance in obtaining other health insurance; referral to transitional housing, if available, or assistance in securing other housing; and assistance in obtaining employment or other financial support.(D) Assistance in applying for admission to college or to a vocational training program or other educational institution and in obtaining financial aid, where appropriate.(E) Assistance in maintaining relationships with individuals who are important to a child who has been in out-of-home placement in a group home for six months or longer from the date the child entered foster care, based on the child’s best interests.(b) The court may continue jurisdiction if it finds that the county welfare department has not met the requirements of paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) and that termination of jurisdiction would be harmful to the best interests of the child. If the court determines that continued jurisdiction is warranted pursuant to this section, the continuation shall only be ordered for that period of time necessary for the county welfare department to meet the requirements of paragraph (2) of subdivision (a). This section shall not be construed to limit the discretion of the juvenile court to continue jurisdiction for other reasons. The court may terminate jurisdiction if the county welfare department has offered the required services, and the child either has refused the services or, after reasonable efforts by the county welfare department, cannot be located.(c) The Judicial Council shall develop and implement standards, and develop and
				  adopt appropriate forms, necessary to implement this section.SEC. 188. Section 618.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended and renumbered to read:681.5 If a prosecuting attorney has appeared on behalf of the people of the State of California in any juvenile court hearing which is based upon a petition that alleges that a minor is a person within the description of Section 602, neither that prosecuting attorney nor any attorney from the office of that prosecuting attorney shall represent the minor in a juvenile court proceeding alleging that a minor is a person described in Section 300.SEC. 189. Section 903.1 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:903.1. (a) The father, mother, spouse, or other person liable for the support of a minor, the estate of that person, and the estate of the minor, shall be liable for the cost to the county of legal services rendered to the minor by the public defender or other public attorney pursuant to an order of the juvenile court, or for the cost to the county for the legal services rendered to the minor by an attorney in private practice appointed pursuant to an order of the juvenile court. The father, mother, spouse, or other person liable for the support of a minor and the estate of that person shall also be liable for any cost to the county of legal services rendered directly to the father, mother, or spouse of the minor, or any other person liable for the support of the minor, in a dependency proceeding
				  by the public defender or other public attorney appointed pursuant to an order of the juvenile court, or by an attorney in private practice appointed pursuant to order of the juvenile court. The liability of those persons (in this article called relatives) and estates shall be a joint and several liability.(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), the father, mother, spouse, or other person liable for the support of the minor, the estate of that person, or the estate of the minor, shall not be liable for the costs of any of the legal services provided to any person described in this section if a petition to declare the minor a dependent child of the court pursuant to Section 300 is dismissed at or before the jurisdictional hearing.SEC. 190. Section 4688.6 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:4688.6. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the department may receive and approve a proposal or proposals by any regional center to provide for, secure, or ensure the full payment of a lease or leases on housing based on the availability for occupancy in each home. These proposals shall not include an adult residential facility for persons with special health care needs, as defined in Section 1567.50 of the Health and Safety Code.

For purposes of this subdivision, “significant renovations” means renovations that exceed 5 percent of the purchase price
				  of the home.(4) The proposal includes a plan for a transfer at a time certain of the real property’s ownership to a nonprofit entity to be approved by the regional center.(5) The regional center has submitted, with the proposal, the nonrefundable developer fee established in subdivision (d).(b) Prior to approving a regional center proposal pursuant to subdivision (a), the department may contract or consult with a public or private sector entity that has appropriate experience in structuring complex real estate financial transactions, but is not otherwise involved in any lending related to the project to review any of the following:(1) The terms and conditions of the financing structure for acquisition or development of the real property.(2) Any and all agreements that govern the real property’s ownership, occupancy, maintenance, management, and operation, to ensure that the use of the property is maintained for the benefit of persons with developmental disabilities.(c) The department may impose a limit on the number of proposals considered pursuant to subdivision (a). If a limit is imposed, the department shall notify the Association of Regional Center Agencies.(d) (1) The department shall charge the developer of the housing described in the regional center proposal a reasonable, nonrefundable fee for each proposal submitted. The fee shall be for the purpose of reimbursing the department’s costs associated with conducting the review and approval required by subdivision (b). The fee shall be set by the department within 30 days
				  of the effective date of the act that added this section, and shall be adjusted annually, as necessary, to ensure the payment of the costs incurred by the department.(2) Fees collected shall be deposited in the Developmental Disabilities Services Account established pursuant to Section 14672.9 of the Government Code and shall be used solely for the purpose of conducting the review and approval required by subdivision (b), upon appropriation by the Legislature.

				  establish guidelines and procedures for the administration of this section.SEC. 191. Section 4691 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:4691. (a) The Legislature reaffirms its intent that community-based day programs be planned and provided as part of a continuum of services to enable persons with developmental disabilities to approximate the pattern of everyday living available to people of the same age without disabilities. The Legislature further intends that standards be developed to ensure high-quality services, and that equitable ratesetting procedures based upon those standards be established, maintained, and revised, as necessary. The Legislature intends that ratesetting procedures be developed for all community-based day programs, which include adult development centers, activity centers, infant day programs, behavior management programs, social recreational programs, and independent living programs.(b) For the purpose of ensuring that regional centers may secure high quality services for persons with developmental disabilities, the State Department of Developmental Services shall promulgate regulations establishing program standards and an equitable process for setting rates of state payment for community-based day programs. These regulations shall include, but are not limited to, all of the following:(1) The standards and requirements related to the operation of the program including, but not limited to, staff qualifications, staff-to-client ratios, client entrance and exit criteria, program design, program evaluation, program and client records and documentation, client placement, and personnel requirements and functions.(2) The allowable cost components of the program including salary and wages, staff
				  benefits, operating expenses, and management organization costs where two or more programs are operated by a separate and distinct corporation or entity.(3) The rate determination processes for establishing rates, based on the allowable costs of the allowable cost components. Different rate determination processes may be developed for establishing rates for new and existing programs, and for the initial and subsequent years of implementation of the regulations. The processes shall include, but are not limited to, all of the following:(A) The procedure for identification and grouping of programs by type of day program and approved staff-to-client ratio.(B) The requirements for an identification of the program, cost, and other information, if any, which the program is required to submit to the department or the

If the funds appropriated in the Budget Act are not sufficient to fully provide for the proposed increase in the rates of reimbursement for all eligible programs for the entire fiscal year, the proposed increase shall be limited to the level of funds appropriated. The increases proposed in the rates of reimbursement shall be reduced equitably among all eligible providers in accordance with funds appropriated and the eligible programs shall be reimbursed at the reduced amount for the entire fiscal year.(d) Using the reported costs of
				  day programs reimbursed at a permanent rate and the standards and ratesetting processes promulgated pursuant to subdivision (b) as a basis, the department shall report to the Legislature as follows:(1) By April 15, 1993, and every odd year thereafter, the difference between permanent rates for existing programs and the rates of those programs based upon their allowable costs and client attendance, submitted pursuant to the regulations specified in subdivision (b). In reporting the difference, the department shall also identify the amount of the difference associated with programs whose rates are above the allowable range of rates, which is available for increasing the rates of programs whose rates are below the allowable range, to within the allowable range, and any other pertinent cost or rate information which the department deems necessary.(2) By April 15, 1994, and every
				  even year thereafter, the level of funding, if any, which was not appropriated to reimburse providers at the proposed rates reported the prior fiscal year pursuant to paragraph (1), and any other pertinent cost or rate information which the department deems necessary.(3) The April 15, 1996, report pursuant to paragraph (2) shall be prepared jointly by the department and organizations representing community-based day program providers, as determined by the department.

The
				  schedule shall consist of a sliding scale for families with an annual gross income not less than 400 percent of the federal poverty guideline, and be adjusted for the level of annual gross income and the number of persons living in the family home.(2) The schedule established pursuant to this section shall be exempt from the rulemaking provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code).(c) Family cost participation assessments shall only be applied to respite, day care, and camping services that are included in the child’s individual program plan or individualized family service plan for children zero through two years of age.(d) If there is more than one minor child living in the parents’ home and receiving

Parents who subsequently provide income documentation that results in a reduction in their cost participation shall be reimbursed for the actual cost difference incurred for services identified in the individual program plan or individualized family service plan for respite, day care, and camping services, for 90 calendar days preceding the reassessment. The actual cost difference is the difference between the maximum cost participation originally assessed and the reassessed amount using the parents’ complete income documentation, that is substantiated with receipts showing that the services have been purchased by the parents.(5) The executive director of the regional center may grant a cost participation adjustment for parents who incur an unavoidable and uninsured catastrophic loss with direct economic impact on the family or who substantiate, with receipts, significant unreimbursed medical costs associated with
				  care for a child who is a regional center consumer. A redetermination of the cost participation adjustment shall be made at least annually.(h) A provider of respite, day care, or camping services shall not charge a rate for the parents’ share of cost that is higher than the rate paid by the regional center for its share of cost.(i) The department shall develop, and regional centers shall use, all forms and documents necessary to administer the program established pursuant to this section. The forms and documents shall be posted on the department’s Internet Web site.

Consumers in a group shall be scheduled to start
				  and end work at the same time, unless an exception that takes into consideration the consumer’s compensated work schedule is approved in advance by the regional center. The department, in consultation with stakeholders, shall adopt regulations to define the appropriate grounds for granting these exceptions. When the number of consumers in a supported employment placement group drops to fewer than the minimum required in subdivision (r) of Section 4851, the regional center may terminate funding for the group services in that group, unless, within 90 days, the program provider adds one or more regional centers, or Department of Rehabilitation-funded supported employment consumers to the group.(c) Job coaching hours for group services shall be allocated on a prorated basis between a regional center and the Department of Rehabilitation when regional center and Department of Rehabilitation consumers are served in the same group.(d) When Section 4855 applies, fees shall be authorized for the following:(1) A three-hundred-sixty-dollar ($360) fee shall be paid to the program provider upon intake of a consumer into a supported employment program. No fee shall be paid if that consumer completed a supported employment intake process with that same supported employment program within the previous 12 months.(2) A seven-hundred-twenty-dollar ($720) fee shall be paid upon placement of a consumer in an integrated job, except that no fee shall be paid if that consumer is placed with another consumer or consumers assigned to the same job coach during the same hours of employment.(3) A seven-hundred-twenty-dollar ($720) fee shall be paid after a 90-day retention of a consumer in a job,
				  except that no fee shall be paid if that consumer has been placed with another consumer or consumers, assigned to the same job coach during the same hours of employment.(e) Notwithstanding paragraph (4) of subdivision (a) of Section 4648 the regional center shall pay the supported employment program rates established by this section.SEC. 194. Section 5777 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:5777. (a) (1) Except as otherwise specified in this part, a contract entered into pursuant to this part shall include a provision that the mental health plan contractor shall bear the financial risk for the cost of providing medically necessary mental health services to Medi-Cal beneficiaries irrespective of whether the cost of those services exceeds the payment set forth in the contract. If the expenditures for services do not exceed the payment set forth in the contract, the mental health plan contractor shall report the unexpended amount to the department, but shall not be required to return the excess to the department.(2) If the mental health plan is not the county’s, the mental health plan may not
				  transfer the obligation for any mental health services to Medi-Cal beneficiaries to the county. The mental health plan may purchase services from the county. The mental health plan shall establish mutually agreed-upon protocols with the county that clearly establish conditions under which beneficiaries may obtain non-Medi-Cal reimbursable services from the county. Additionally, the plan shall establish mutually agreed-upon protocols with the county for the conditions of transfer of beneficiaries who have lost Medi-Cal eligibility to the county for care under Part 2 (commencing with Section 5600), Part 3 (commencing with Section 5800), and Part 4 (commencing with Section 5850).(3) The mental health plan shall be financially responsible for ensuring access and a minimum required scope of benefits, consistent with state and federal requirements, to the services to the Medi-Cal beneficiaries of that county regardless of where the beneficiary
				  resides. The department shall require that the definition of medical necessity used, and the minimum scope of benefits offered, by each mental health contractor be the same, except to the extent that any variations receive prior federal approval and are consistent with state and federal statutes and regulations.(b) Any contract entered into pursuant to this part may be renewed if the plan continues to meet the requirements of this part, regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, and the terms and conditions of the contract. Failure to meet these requirements shall be cause for nonrenewal of the contract. The department may base the decision to renew on timely completion of a mutually agreed-upon plan of correction of any deficiencies, submissions of required information in a timely manner, or other conditions of the contract. At the discretion of the department, each contract may be renewed for a period not to exceed three years.(c) (1) The obligations of the mental health plan shall be changed only by contract or contract amendment.(2) A change may be made during a contract term or at the time of contract renewal, where there is a change in obligations required by federal or state law or when required by a change in the interpretation or implementation of any law or regulation. To the extent permitted by federal law and except as provided under paragraph (10) of subdivision (c) of Section 5778, if any change in obligations occurs that affects the cost to the mental health plan of performing under the terms of its contract, the department may reopen contracts to negotiate the state General Fund allocation to the mental health plan under Section 5778, if the mental health plan is reimbursed through a fee-for-service payment system, or the capitation rate to the mental health plan under
				  Section 5779, if the mental health plan is reimbursed through a capitated rate payment system. During the time period required to redetermine the allocation or rate, payment to the mental health plan of the allocation or rate in effect at the time the change occurred shall be considered interim payments and shall be subject to increase or decrease, as the case may be, effective as of the date on which the change is effective.(3) To the extent permitted by federal law, either the department or the mental health plan may request that contract negotiations be reopened during the course of a contract due to substantial changes in the cost of covered benefits that result from an unanticipated event.(d) The department shall immediately terminate a contract when the director finds that there is an immediate threat to the health and safety of Medi-Cal beneficiaries. Termination of the
				  contract for other reasons shall be subject to reasonable notice of the department’s intent to take that action and notification of affected beneficiaries. The plan may request a public hearing by the Office of Administrative Hearings.(e) A plan may terminate its contract in accordance with the provisions in the contract. The plan shall provide written notice to the department at least 180 days prior to the termination or nonrenewal of the contract.(f) Upon the request of the Director of Mental Health, the Director of Managed Health Care may exempt a mental health plan contractor or a capitated rate contract from the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975 (Chapter 2.2 (commencing with Section 1340) of Division 2 of the Health and Safety Code). These exemptions may be subject to conditions the director deems appropriate. Nothing in this part shall be construed to impair
				  or diminish the authority of the Director of Managed Health Care under the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, nor shall anything in this part be construed to reduce or otherwise limit the obligation of a mental health plan contractor licensed as a health care service plan to comply with the requirements of the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, and the rules of the Director of Managed Health Care promulgated thereunder. The Director of Mental Health, in consultation with the Director of Managed Health Care, shall analyze the appropriateness of licensure or application of applicable standards of the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975.(g) (1) The department, pursuant to an agreement with the State Department of Health Care Services, shall provide oversight to the mental health plans to ensure quality, access, and cost efficiency. At a minimum, the department shall, through a method
				  independent of any agency of the mental health plan contractor, monitor the level and quality of services provided, expenditures pursuant to the contract, and conformity with federal and state law.(2) (A) Commencing July 1, 2008, county mental health plans, in collaboration with the department, the federally required external review organization, providers, and other stakeholders, shall establish an advisory statewide performance improvement project (PIP) to increase the coordination, quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of service delivery to children who are either receiving at least three thousand dollars ($3,000) per month in the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) Program services or children identified in the top 5 percent of the county EPSDT cost, whichever is lowest. The statewide PIP shall replace one of the two required PIPs that mental health plans must perform under federal
				  regulations outlined in the mental health plan contract.(B) The federally required external quality review organization shall provide independent oversight and reviews with recommendations and findings or summaries of findings, as appropriate, from a statewide perspective. This information shall be accessible to county mental health plans, the department, county welfare directors, providers, and other interested stakeholders in a manner that both facilitates, and allows for, a comprehensive quality improvement process for the EPSDT Program.(C) Each July, the department, in consultation with the federally required external quality review organization and the county mental health plans, shall determine the average monthly cost threshold for counties to use to identify children to be reviewed who are currently receiving EPSDT services. The department shall consult with
				  representatives of county mental health directors, county welfare directors, providers, and the federally required external quality review organization in setting the annual average monthly cost threshold and in implementing the statewide PIP. The department shall provide an annual update to the Legislature on the results of this statewide PIP by October 1 of each year for the prior fiscal year.(D) It is the intent of the Legislature for the EPSDT PIP to increase the coordination, quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of service delivery to children receiving EPSDT services and to facilitate evidence-based practices within the program, and other high-quality practices consistent with the values of the public mental health system within the program to ensure that children are receiving appropriate mental health services for their mental health wellness.(E) This paragraph shall
				  become inoperative on September 1, 2011.(h) County employees implementing or administering a mental health plan act in a discretionary capacity when they determine whether or not to admit a person for care or to provide any level of care pursuant to this part.(i) If a county chooses to discontinue operations as the local mental health plan, the new plan shall give reasonable consideration to affiliation with nonprofit community mental health agencies that were under contract with the county and that meet the mental health plan’s quality and cost efficiency standards.(j) Nothing in this part shall be construed to modify, alter, or increase the obligations of counties as otherwise limited and defined in Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 5700) of Part 2. The county’s maximum obligation for services to persons not
				  eligible for Medi-Cal shall be no more than the amount of funds remaining in the mental health subaccount pursuant to Sections 17600, 17601, 17604, 17605, 17606, and 17609 after fulfilling the Medi-Cal contract obligations.SEC. 195. Section 11402.6 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:11402.6. (a) The federal government has provided the state with the option of including in its state plan children placed in a private facility operated on a for-profit basis.(b) For children for whom the county placing agency has exhausted all other placement options, notwithstanding subdivision (h) of Section 11400 and subject to Section 15200.5, a child who is otherwise eligible for federal financial participation in the AFDC-FC payment shall be eligible for aid under this chapter when the child is placed in a for-profit child care institution and meets all of the following criteria, which shall be clearly documented in the county welfare department case file:(1) The child has extraordinary and unusual special behavioral or medical needs that make the child difficult to place, including, but not limited to, being medically fragile, brittle diabetic, having severe head injuries, a dual diagnosis of mental illness and substance abuse or a dual diagnosis of developmental delay and mental illness.(2) No other comparable private nonprofit facility or public licensed residential care home exists in the state that is willing to accept placement and is capable of meeting the child’s extraordinary special needs.(3) The county placing agency has demonstrated that no other alternate placement option exists for the child.(4) The child has a developmental disability and is eligible for both federal AFDC-FC payments and for regional center services.(c) Federal financial participation shall be provided pursuant to Section 11402 for children described in subdivision (a) subject to all of the following conditions, which shall be clearly documented in the county welfare department case file.(1) The county placing agency enters into a performance-based placement agreement with the for-profit facility to ensure the facility is providing services to improve the safety, permanency, and well-being outcomes of the placed children pursuant to Section 10601.2.(2) The county placing agency will require the facility to ensure placement in the child’s community to the degree possible to enhance ongoing connections with the child’s family and to promote the establishment of lifelong connections with committed adults.(3) The county placing agency monitors and reviews the facility’s outcome performance indicators every six months.(4) In no event shall federal financial participation in this placement exceed a 12-month period.(5) Payments made under this section shall not be made on behalf of any more than five children in a county at any one time.(6) Payments made under this section shall be made pursuant to Sections 4684 and 11464, and only to a group home that is an approved vendor of a regional center.(d) This section shall be implemented only during a federal fiscal year in which the department determines that no restriction on federal matching AFDC-FC payment exists.(e) As used in

				  worker.(4) Administrative costs of the pilot project, including the cost of developing guidelines other than the guidelines in this section and the cost of administering the project and providing oversight, shall not be paid by the state. Instead, an estimate of administrative costs shall be included in the county request for proposal for each contract with the voluntary nonprofit or proprietary agency and administrative costs shall then be paid by the agency up to the amount estimated unless the county and agency reach an alternative cost-sharing agreement in the contract that does not involve state participation.(b) (1) (A) For purposes of this section, to the extent possible, all providers employed by the voluntary nonprofit or proprietary agency shall be persons previously listed on the public authority’s registry.

This shall not prohibit any public authority from using the funding it receives pursuant to paragraph (4) of subdivision (a) for newsletters and other means of communication about training opportunities available through the voluntary nonprofit or proprietary agency.(C) All providers employed by the voluntary
				  nonprofit or proprietary agency shall be paid no less than the wages and benefits provided for in the public authority’s collective bargaining agreement, provided that this provision shall not obligate the state to participate in a contract rate higher than the maximum allowable contract rate.

Any costs associated with the development and maintenance of the upskilling program shall be paid solely by the voluntary nonprofit or
				  proprietary agency.(G) Be liable for any fraud, waste, or abuse for which it is responsible.(3) For the duration of the pilot project, supportive services not provided in any month due to hospitalization, illness, refusal, or other cause not within the control of the provider shall not be made up in a subsequent period without caseworker approval.(c) (1) In each participating county, the IHSS advisory committee, as described in Section 12301.3, shall monitor the pilot program.(2) Each participating county shall not be eligible to receive state reimbursement of administrative costs associated with monitoring the pilot program.

Services appropriately provided through the store and forward process are subject to billing and reimbursement policies developed by the department.(b) For purposes of this section, “teleophthalmology and teledermatology by store and forward” means an asynchronous transmission of medical information to be reviewed at a later time by a physician at a distant site who is trained in ophthalmology or dermatology, where the physician at the distant site
				  reviews the medical information without the patient being present in real time. A patient receiving teleophthalmology or teledermatology by store and forward shall be notified of the right to receive interactive communication with the distant specialist physician, and shall receive an interactive communication with the distant specialist physician, upon request. If requested, communication with the distant specialist physician may occur either at the time of the consultation, or within 30 days of the patient’s notification of the results of the consultation.(c) Notwithstanding Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, the department may implement, interpret, and make specific this section by means of all-county letters, provider bulletins, and similar instructions.(d) On or before January 1, 2008, the department shall
				  report to the Legislature the number and type of services provided, and the payments made related to the application of store and forward telemedicine as provided, under this section as a Medi-Cal benefit.(e) The health care provider shall comply with the informed consent provisions of subdivisions (c) to (g), inclusive, of, and subdivisions (i) and (j) of, Section 2290.5 of the Business and Professions Code when a patient receives teleophthalmology or teledermatology by store and forward.(f) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2013, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2013, deletes or extends that date.SEC. 210. Section 14154 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:14154. (a) The department shall establish and maintain a plan whereby costs for county administration of the determination of eligibility for benefits under this chapter shall be effectively controlled within the amounts annually appropriated for that administration. The plan, to be known as the County Administrative Cost Control Plan, shall establish standards and performance criteria, including workload, productivity, and support services standards, to which counties shall adhere. The plan shall include standards for controlling eligibility determination costs that are incurred by performing eligibility determinations at county hospitals, or that are incurred due to the outstationing of any other eligibility function. Except as provided in Section 14154.15, reimbursement to a county for
				  outstationed eligibility functions shall be based solely on productivity standards applied to that county’s welfare department office. The plan shall be part of a single state plan, jointly developed by the department and the State Department of Social Services, in conjunction with the counties, for administrative cost control for the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs), Food Stamp, and Medical Assistance (Medi-Cal) programs. Allocations shall be made to each county and shall be limited by and determined based upon the County Administrative Cost Control Plan. In administering the plan to control county administrative costs, the department shall not allocate state funds to cover county cost overruns that result from county failure to meet requirements of the plan. The department and the State Department of Social Services shall budget, administer, and allocate state funds for county administration in a uniform and consistent manner.(b) Nothing in this section, Section 15204.5, or Section 18906 shall be construed so as to limit the administrative or budgetary responsibilities of the department in a manner that would violate Section 14100.1, and thereby jeopardize federal financial participation under the Medi-Cal program.(c) (1) The Legislature finds and declares that in order for counties to do the work that is expected of them, it is necessary that they receive adequate funding, including adjustments for reasonable annual cost-of-doing-business increases. The Legislature further finds and declares that linking appropriate funding for county Medi-Cal administrative operations, including annual cost-of-doing-business adjustments, with performance standards will give counties the incentive to meet the performance standards and enable them to continue to do the work they do on behalf of the
				  state. It is therefore the Legislature’s intent to provide appropriate funding to the counties for the effective administration of the Medi-Cal program at the local level to ensure that counties can reasonably meet the purposes of the performance measures as contained in this section.(2) It is the intent of the Legislature to not appropriate funds for the cost-of-doing-business adjustment for the 2008–09 fiscal year.(d) The department is responsible for the Medi-Cal program in accordance with state and federal law. A county shall determine Medi-Cal eligibility in accordance with state and federal law. If in the course of its duties the department becomes aware of accuracy problems in any county, the department shall, within available resources, provide training and technical assistance as appropriate. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to eliminate any remedy otherwise
				  available to the department to enforce accurate county administration of the program. In administering the Medi-Cal eligibility process, each county shall meet the following performance standards each fiscal year:(1) Complete eligibility determinations as follows:(A) Ninety percent of the general applications without applicant errors and that are complete shall be completed within 45 days.(B) Ninety percent of the applications for Medi-Cal based on disability shall be completed within 90 days, excluding delays by the state.(2) (A) The department shall establish best-practice guidelines for expedited enrollment of newborns into the Medi-Cal program, preferably with the goal of enrolling newborns within 10 days after the county
				  is informed of the birth. The department, in consultation with counties and other stakeholders, shall work to develop a process for expediting enrollment for all newborns, including those born to mothers receiving CalWORKs assistance.(B) Upon the development and implementation of the best-practice guidelines and expedited processes, the department and the counties may develop an expedited enrollment timeframe for newborns that is separate from the standards for all other applications, to the extent that the timeframe is consistent with these guidelines and processes.(C) Notwithstanding the rulemaking procedures of Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, the department may implement this section by means of all-county letters or similar instructions, without further regulatory action.(3) Perform timely annual redeterminations, as follows:(A) Ninety percent of the annual redetermination forms shall be mailed to the recipient by the anniversary date.(B) Ninety percent of the annual redeterminations shall be completed within 60 days of the recipient’s annual redetermination date for those redeterminations based on forms that are complete and have been returned to the county by the recipient in a timely manner.(C) Ninety percent of those annual redeterminations where the redetermination form has not been returned to the county by the recipient shall be completed by sending a notice of action to the recipient within 45 days after the date the form was due to the county.(D) When a child is determined by the county to change from no share of cost to a share of cost and the child meets the eligibility criteria for the Healthy Families Program established under Section 12693.98 of the Insurance Code, the child shall be placed in the Medi-Cal-to-Healthy Families Bridge Benefits Program, and these cases shall be processed as follows:(i) Ninety percent of the families of these children shall be sent a notice informing them of the Healthy Families Program within five working days from the determination of a share of cost.(ii) Ninety percent of all annual redetermination forms for these children shall be sent to the Healthy Families Program within five working days from the determination of a share of cost if the parent has given consent to send this information to the Healthy Families Program.(iii) Ninety percent of the families of these children placed in the Medi-Cal-to-Healthy Families Bridge Benefits Program who have not consented to sending the child’s annual redetermination form to the Healthy Families Program shall be sent a request, within five working days of the determination of a share of cost, to consent to send the information to the Healthy Families Program.(E) Subparagraph (D) shall not be implemented until 60 days after the Medi-Cal and Joint Medi-Cal and Healthy Families applications and the Medi-Cal redetermination forms are revised to allow the parent of a child to consent to forward the child’s information to the Healthy Families Program.(e) The department shall develop procedures in collaboration with the counties and stakeholder groups for determining county review cycles, sampling
				  methodology and procedures, and data reporting.(f) On January 1 of each year, each applicable county, as determined by the department, shall report to the department on the county’s results in meeting the performance standards specified in this section. The report shall be subject to verification by the department. County reports shall be provided to the public upon written request.(g) If the department finds that a county is not in compliance with one or more of the standards set forth in this section, the county shall, within 60 days, submit a corrective action plan to the department for approval. The corrective action plan shall, at a minimum, include steps that the county shall take to improve its performance on the standard of standards with which the county is out of compliance. The plan shall establish interim benchmarks for improvement that shall be expected to be met by
				  the county in order to avoid a sanction.(h) (1) If a county does not meet the performance standards for completing eligibility determinations and redeterminations as specified in this section, the department may, at its sole discretion, reduce the allocation of funds to that county in the following year by 2 percent. Any funds so reduced may be restored by the department if, in the determination of the department, sufficient improvement has been made by the county in meeting the performance standards during the year for which the funds were reduced. If the county continues not to meet the performance standards, the department may reduce the allocation by an additional 2 percent for each year thereafter in which sufficient improvement has not been made to meet the performance standards.(2) No reduction of the allocation of funds to a county shall be imposed
				  pursuant to this subdivision for failure to meet performance standards during any period of time in which the cost-of-doing-business increase is suspended.(i) The department shall develop procedures, in collaboration with the counties and stakeholders, for developing instructions for the performance standards established under subparagraph (D) of paragraph (3) of subdivision (c), no later than September 1, 2005.(j) No later than September 1, 2005, the department shall issue a revised annual redetermination form to allow a parent to indicate parental consent to forward the annual redetermination form to the Healthy Families Program if the child is determined to have a share of cost.(k) The department, in coordination with the Managed Risk Medical Insurance Board, shall streamline the method of providing the Healthy
				  Families Program with information necessary to determine Healthy Families eligibility for a child who is receiving services under the Medi-Cal-to-Healthy Families Bridge Benefits Program.SEC. 211. Section 14154.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:14154.5. (a) Each county shall work, on a routine basis, any error alert from the department’s Medi-Cal Eligibility Data System (MEDS). Any alert that affects eligibility or the share of cost that is received by the 10th working day of the month shall be processed in time for the change to be effective the beginning of the following month. Any alert that affects eligibility or the share of cost that is received after the 10th working day of the month shall be processed in time for the change to be effective the beginning of the month after the following month. The department shall consult with the County Welfare Directors Association to define those alerts that affect eligibility or the share of cost.(b) The county shall submit
				  reconciliation files of its Medi-Cal eligible population to the department every three months, based upon a schedule determined by the department and in a format prescribed by the department, to identify any discrepancies between eligibility files in the county records and eligibility as reflected in MEDS. Counties shall be notified of any changes to the standard format for submitting reconciliation files sufficiently in advance to allow for budgeting, scheduling, development, testing, and implementation of any required change in county automated eligibility systems.(c) For those records that are on the county’s files, but not on MEDS, the county shall receive worker alerts from the department that identify these cases, and the county shall fix any data discrepancies. Any worker alert received by the 10th working day of the month shall be processed in time for the change to be effective the beginning of the following month. Any worker alert
				  received after the 10th working day of the month shall be processed in time for the change to be effective the beginning of the month after the following month.(d) In regard to any record that is on MEDS but not on the county’s file, the county shall either correct the county record or MEDS, whichever is appropriate, within the same timeframes specified in subdivision (c).(e) The department shall terminate a MEDS-eligible record if the person is not eligible on the county’s file when there has been no eligibility update on the MEDS record for six months.(f) (1) If the department finds that a county is not performing all of the following activities, the county shall, within 60 days, submit a corrective action plan to the department for approval:(A) Conducting reconciliations as required in subdivision (b).(B) Processing 95 percent of worker alerts referred to in subdivisions (c) and (d), within the timeframes specified.(C) Processing 90 percent of the error alerts referred to in subdivision (a) that affect eligibility or the share of cost, within the timeframes specified.(2) The corrective action plan shall, at a minimum, include steps that the county shall take to improve its performance on the requirements with which the county is out of compliance. The plan shall establish interim benchmarks for improvement that shall be expected to be met by the county in order to avoid sanctions.(g) (1) If the county does
				  not meet the interim benchmarks for improvement standards, the department may, in its sole discretion, reduce the allocation of funds to that county in the following year by 2 percent. Any funds so reduced may be restored by the department if, in the determination of the department, sufficient improvement has been made by the county in meeting the performance standards during the year for which the funds were reduced.(2) No reduction of the allocation of funds to a county shall be imposed pursuant to this subdivision for failure to meet performance standards during any period of time in which the cost-of-doing-business increase is suspended.(h) The department, in consultation with the County Welfare Directors Association, shall investigate features that could be installed in MEDS to reduce the number of alerts and streamline the reconciliation process.(i) Notwithstanding the rulemaking provisions of Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, the department may implement, interpret, or make specific this section by means of all-county letters, provider bulletins, or similar instructions. Thereafter, the department may adopt regulations in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code.SEC. 212. Section 14166.9 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:14166.9. (a) The department, in consultation with the designated public hospitals, shall determine the mix of sources of federal funds for payments to the designated public hospitals in a manner that provides baseline funding to hospitals and maximizes federal Medicaid funding to the state during the term of the demonstration project. Federal funds shall be claimed according to the following priorities:(1) The certified public expenditures of the designated public hospitals for inpatient hospital services and physician and nonphysician practitioner services, as identified in subdivision (e) of Section 14166.4, rendered to Medi-Cal beneficiaries.(2) Federal
				  disproportionate share hospital allotment, subject to the federal hospital-specific limit, in the following order:(A) Those hospital expenditures that are eligible for federal financial participation only from the federal disproportionate share hospital allotment.(B) Payments funded with intergovernmental transfers, consistent with the requirements of the demonstration project, up to the hospital’s baseline funding amount or adjusted baseline funding amount, as appropriate, for the project year.(C) Any other certified public expenditures for hospital services that are eligible for federal financial participation from the federal disproportionate share hospital allotment.(3) Safety net care pool funds, using the optimal combination of
				  hospital-certified public expenditures and certified public expenditures of a hospital, or governmental entity with which the hospital is affiliated, that operates nonhospital clinics or provides physician, nonphysician practitioner, or other health care services that are not identified as hospital services under the Special Terms and Conditions for the demonstration project, except that certified public expenditures reported by the County of Los Angeles or its designated public hospitals shall be the exclusive source of certified public expenditures for claiming those federal funds deposited in the South Los Angeles Medical Services Preservation Fund under Section 14166.25.(4) Health care expenditures of the state that represent alternate state funding mechanisms approved by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under the demonstration project as set forth in Section 14166.22.(b) The department shall implement these priorities, to the extent possible, in a manner that minimizes the redistribution of federal funds that are based on the certified public expenditures of the designated public hospitals.(c) The department may adjust the claiming priorities to the extent that these adjustments result in additional federal medicaid funding during the term of the demonstration project or facilitate the objectives of subdivision (b).(d) There is hereby established in the State Treasury the “Demonstration Disproportionate Share Hospital Fund.” All federal funds received by the department with respect to the certified public expenditures claimed pursuant to subparagraphs (A) and (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) shall be transferred to the fund. Notwithstanding Section 13340 of the Government
				  Code, the fund shall be continuously appropriated to the department solely for the purposes specified in Section 14166.6.(e) (1) Except as provided in Section 14166.25, all federal safety net care pool funds claimed and received by the department based on health care expenditures incurred by the designated public hospitals, or other governmental entities, shall be transferred to the Health Care Support Fund, established pursuant to Section 14166.21.(2) The department shall separately identify and account for federal safety net care pool funds claimed and received by the department under the health care coverage initiative program authorized under Part 3.5 (commencing with Section 15900) and under paragraphs 43 and 44 of the Special Terms and Conditions for the demonstration project.(3) With
				  respect to those funds identified under paragraph (2), the department shall separately identify and account for federal safety net care pool funds claimed and received for inpatient hospital services rendered under the health care coverage initiative, including services rendered to enrollees of a managed care organization, by designated public hospitals, nondesignated public hospitals, and project year private DSH hospitals.SEC. 213. Section 14166.25 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:14166.25. (a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:(1) In light of the closure of Los Angeles County Martin Luther King, Jr.-Harbor Hospital, there is a need to ensure adequate funding for continued health care services to the uninsured population of South Los Angeles, including, but not limited to, the Cities of Compton, Lynwood, South Gate, and Huntington Park, the southern and central portions of the Cities of Los Angeles, Inglewood, Gardena, and surrounding unincorporated communities.(2) The state, the County of Los Angeles, and all health care providers in the South Los Angeles community must work together to meet the health care needs of the
				  community until the critical hospital services previously provided by Los Angeles County Martin Luther King, Jr.-Harbor Hospital can be restored at this location.(3) The Medi-Cal Hospital/Uninsured Care Demonstration Project provides a critical source of funding for services to low-income communities throughout the state that are provided by California’s safety net hospital systems.(4) The special funding provided in this section is predicated on the express intent of the County of Los Angeles to restore hospital services on the hospital campus, to be operated by either a private or public entity. The county has undertaken a specific plan to do so as quickly as possible.(5) The Legislature anticipates that demonstration project funds will be available to help fund the reopened hospital. The nature and amount of
