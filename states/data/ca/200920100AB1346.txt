						HallFebruary 27, 2009 An act to amend Section 2945.7 of the Civil Code, relating to foreclosure consultants. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1346, as introduced, Hall.
											  Foreclosure consultants.Existing law regulates foreclosure consultants and, in this regard, defines a foreclosure consultant as a person who performs, or who solicits, represents, or offers to perform, for compensation, specified activities, including the obtaining of forbearance from a beneficiary or mortgagee. Existing law provides that a foreclosure consultant who receives any fee before fully performing every service for which he or she has contracted is guilty of a misdemeanor. This bill would make nonsubstantive, technical changes to these provisions. Digest Key
