Specifically, a court has the discretion to resentence or recall a sentence if a prisoner is terminally ill with an incurable condition caused by illness or disease that would produce death within months, as determined by a physician, or permanently medically incapacitated, as specified, and the conditions under which the prisoner would be released or receive treatment do not pose a threat to public safety.This bill would declare the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation that would permit the early release of state prisoners who meet certain age and illness criteria.Digest Key
