		waste source reduction.This bill would additionally require the department to assume authority, duties, powers, purposes, responsibilities, and jurisdiction of the board, as described, and would change the department’s name to the Department of Toxics and Waste Management.The California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989, administered by the California Integrated Waste Management Board, is required to reduce, recycle, and reuse solid waste generated in the state to the maximum extent feasible in an efficient cost-effective manner to conserve water, energy, and other natural resources.This bill would abolish the board and transfer all of its authority, duties, powers, purposes, responsibilities, and jurisdiction to the Department of
		Conservation and the Department of Toxic Substances Control, as described.Digest Key

				  governing the contents of revised source reduction and recycling elements to reduce duplications in one or more components of these revised elements.Section 41780.05 of the Public Resources Code is amended to read:41780.05. (a) After January 1, 2009, pursuant to the review authorized by Section 41825, the board Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery shall determine each jurisdiction’s compliance with Section 41780 for the years commencing with January 1, 2007, by comparing each jurisdiction’s change in its per capita disposal rate in subsequent years with the equivalent per capita disposal rate that would have been necessary for the jurisdiction to meet the requirements of Section 41780 on January 1, 2007, as calculated pursuant to subdivisions (c) and (d).(b) (1) For purposes of paragraph (5) of
				  subdivision (e) of Section 41825, in making a determination whether a jurisdiction has made a good faith effort to implement its source reduction and recycling element or its household hazardous waste element, the board Department of Toxics and Waste Management, in conjunction with the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, shall consider, but is not limited to the consideration of, the jurisdiction’s per capita disposal rate and whether the jurisdiction adequately implemented its diversion programs.(2) When determining whether a jurisdiction has made a good faith effort pursuant to Section 41825 to implement its source reduction and recycling element or its household hazardous waste element, the board
				  Department of Toxics and Waste Management, in conjunction with the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, shall consider that an increase in the per capita disposal rate is the result of the amount of the jurisdiction’s disposal increasing faster than the jurisdiction’s growth. The board Department of Toxics and Waste Management, in conjunction with the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, shall use this increase in the per capita disposal rate that is in excess of the equivalent per capita disposal rate as a factor in determining whether the board Department of Toxics and Waste Management, in
				  conjunction with the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery,
				  is required, pursuant to Section 41825, to more closely examine a jurisdiction’s program implementation efforts. This examination may indicate that a jurisdiction is required to expand existing programs or implement new programs, in accordance with the procedures specified in Article 4 (commencing with Section 41825) and in Article 5 (commencing with Section 41850) of Chapter 7.(3) When reviewing the level of program implementation pursuant to Sections 41825 and 41850, the board Department of Toxics and Waste Management, in conjunction with the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, shall use, as a factor in determining compliance with Section 41780, the amount
				  determined pursuant to subdivision (d) when comparing a jurisdiction’s per capita disposal rate in subsequent years.(c) (1) Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, for purposes of this section, “per capita disposal” or “per capita disposal rate” means the total annual disposal, in pounds, from a jurisdiction divided by the total population in a jurisdiction, as reported by the Department of Finance, divided by 365 days.(2) (A) If a jurisdiction is predominated by commercial or industrial activities and by solid waste generation from those sources, the board Department of Toxics and Waste Management, in conjunction with the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, may alternatively calculate per capita
				  disposal to reflect those differing conditions.(B) When making a calculation for a jurisdiction subject to this paragraph, “per capita disposal” or “per capita disposal rate” means the total annual disposal, in pounds, from a jurisdiction divided by total industry employment in a jurisdiction, as reported by the Employment Development Department, divided by 365 days.(C) The board Department of Toxics and Waste Management, in conjunction with the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, shall calculate the per capita disposal rate for a jurisdiction subject to this paragraph using the level of industry employment in a jurisdiction instead of the level of population in a jurisdiction.(3) If the board
				  Department of Toxics and Waste Management, in conjunction with the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, determines that the method for calculating the per capita disposal rate for a jurisdiction provided by paragraph (1) or (2) does not accurately reflect that jurisdiction’s disposal reduction, the board Department of Toxics and Waste Management, in conjunction with the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, may use an alternative per capita factor, other than population or industry employment, to calculate the per capita disposal rate that more accurately reflects the jurisdiction’s efforts to divert solid waste.(d) The board
				  Department of Toxics and Waste Management, in conjunction with the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, shall calculate the equivalent per capita disposal rate for each jurisdiction as follows:(1) Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, the equivalent per capita disposal rate for a jurisdiction shall be determined using the method specified in this paragraph.(A) The calculated generation tonnage for each year from 2003 to 2006, inclusive, shall be multiplied by 0.5 to yield the 50 percent equivalent disposal total for each year.(B) The 50 percent equivalent disposal total for each year shall be multiplied by 2,000, divided by the population of the jurisdiction in that year, and then divided by 365 to yield the 50 percent equivalent per capita disposal for each year.(C) The four 50 percent equivalent per capita disposal amounts from the
				  years 2003 to 2006, inclusive, shall be averaged to yield the equivalent per capita disposal rate.(2) If a jurisdiction is predominated by commercial or industrial activities and by solid waste generation from those sources, the board Department of Toxics and Waste Management, in conjunction with the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery,
				  may alternatively calculate the equivalent per capita disposal rate to reflect those conditions by using the level of industry employment in a jurisdiction instead of the level of population in that jurisdiction.(3) If the board Department of Toxics and Waste Management, in conjunction with the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, determines that the method for calculating the equivalent per capita disposal rate for a jurisdiction pursuant to this subdivision does not accurately reflect a jurisdiction’s per capita disposal rate that would be equivalent to the amount required to meet the 50 percent diversion requirements of Section 41780, the board
				  Department of Toxics and Waste Management, in conjunction with the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, may use an alternative per capita factor, other than population or industry employment, to calculate the equivalent per capita disposal rate that more accurately reflects the jurisdiction’s diversion efforts.(4)  The board Department of Toxics and Waste Management, in conjunction with the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, shall modify the percentage used in paragraph (1) to maintain the diversion requirements approved by the board
				  Department of Toxics and Waste Management, in conjunction with the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, for a rural jurisdiction pursuant to Section 41787 or for a reduction granted pursuant to Section 41786.(5)  The board Department of Toxics and Waste Management, in conjunction with the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, may modify the years included in making a calculation pursuant to this subdivision for an individual jurisdiction to eliminate years in which the calculated generation amount is shown not to be representative or accurate, based upon a generation study completed in one of the five years 2003 to 2007, inclusive. In these cases, the board
				  California Integrated Waste Management Board shall not allow the use of an additional year other than 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, or 2007.(6)  The board Department of Toxics and Waste Management, in conjunction with the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, may modify the method of calculating the equivalent per capita disposal rate for an individual jurisdiction to accommodate the incorporation of a new city, the formation of a new regional agency, or changes in membership of an existing regional agency. These modifications shall ensure that a new entity has a new equivalent per capita disposal rate and that the existing per capita disposal rate of an existing entity is adjusted to take into account the disposal amounts lost by the creation of
				  the new entity.(7) The board California Integrated Waste Management Board shall not incorporate generation studies or new base year calculations for a year commencing after 2006 into the equivalent per capita disposal rate, unless a generation study that included the year 2007 was commenced on or before June 30, 2008.(8) If the board
				  Department of Toxics and Waste Management, in conjunction with the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, determines that the equivalent per capita disposal rate cannot accurately be determined for a jurisdiction, or that the rate is no longer representative of a jurisdiction’s waste stream, the board Department of Toxics and Waste Management, in conjunction with the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, shall evaluate trends in the jurisdiction’s per capita disposal to establish a revised equivalent per capita disposal rate for that jurisdiction.Section 41780.1 of the Public Resources Code is amended to read:41780.1. (a) Notwithstanding any other requirement of this part, for the purposes of determining the amount of solid waste that a regional agency is required to divert from disposal or transformation through source reduction, recycling, and composting to meet the diversion requirements of Section 41780, the regional agency shall use the solid waste disposal projections in the source reduction and recycling elements of the regional agency’s member agencies. The method prescribed in Section 41780.2 shall be used to determine the maximum amount of disposal allowable to meet the diversion requirements of Section 41780.(b) Notwithstanding any other requirement of this part, for the purposes of determining the amount of solid waste that a city or county is required to divert from disposal or transformation
				  through source reduction, recycling, and composting to meet the diversion requirements of Section 41780, the city or county shall use the solid waste disposal projections in the source reduction and recycling elements of the city or county. The method prescribed in Section 41780.2 shall be used to determine the maximum amount of disposal allowable to meet the diversion requirements of Section 41780.(c) To determine achievement of the diversion requirements of Section 41780 in 1995 and in the year 2000, projections of disposal amounts from the source reduction and recycling elements shall be adjusted to reflect annual increases or decreases in population and other factors affecting the waste stream, as determined by the board
				  California Integrated Waste Management Board. By January 1, 1994, the board California Integrated Waste Management Board shall study the factors which affect the generation and disposal of solid waste and shall develop a standard methodology and guidelines to be used by cities, counties, and regional agencies in adjusting disposal projections as required by this section.(d) The amount of additional diversion required to be achieved by a regional agency to meet the diversion requirements of Section 41780 shall be equal to the sum of the diversion requirements of its member agencies. To determine the maximum amount of disposal allowable for the regional agency to meet the diversion requirements of Section 41780, the maximum amount of disposal allowable
				  for each member agency shall be added together to yield the agency disposable maximum.Section 41781.1 of the Public Resources Code is amended to read:41781.1. (a) Prior to determining that the diversion of sludge may be counted toward the diversion requirements established under Section 41780, but within 180 days of receiving such a request, the board Department of Toxics and Waste Management shall do both of the following:(1) Make a finding at a public hearing, based upon substantial evidence, that the sludge has been adequately analyzed and will not pose a threat to public health or the environment for the reuse which is proposed.(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), prior to making the finding required to be made pursuant to
				  this paragraph, the board Department of Toxics and Waste Management shall consult with each of the following agencies, and obtain their concurrence in the finding, to the extent of each agency’s jurisdiction over the sludge or its intended reuse:(i) The state water board and the regional water board.(ii) The State Department of Health Services.(iii) The State Air Resources Board and air pollution control districts and air quality management districts.(iv)The Department of Toxic Substances Control.(B) If, prior to the board Department of Toxics and Waste Management making the finding required to be made pursuant to this paragraph, an agency specified in subparagraph (A) issues a permit, waste discharge requirements, or imposes other conditions for the reuse of sludge, the agency shall have been deemed to have concurred in that finding.(2) Establish, or ensure that one or more of the agencies specified in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) establishes, ongoing monitoring requirements which ensure that the proposed sludge reuse does not pose a threat to health and safety or the environment.(b) It is not the intent of this section to require the board
				  Department of Toxics and Waste Management, or the agencies listed in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a), to impose additional requirements or approval procedures for sludge or sludge reuse applications, apart from the requirements and approval procedures already imposed by state and federal law. It is the intent of this section to require that the board Department of Toxics and Waste Management determine that each sludge diversion, for which diversion credit is sought, meets all applicable requirements of state and federal law, and thereby provides for maximum protection of the public health and safety and the environment.Section 41781.2 of the Public Resources Code is amended to read:41781.2. (a) (1) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this section not to require cities, counties, and regional agencies to revise source reduction and recycling elements prior to their submittal to the board Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery for review and approval, except as the elements would otherwise be required to be revised by the board Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery
				  pursuant to this part. Pursuant to Sections 41801.5 and 41811.5, compliance with this section shall be determined by the board Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery when source reduction and recycling elements are submitted to the board Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery pursuant to Section 41791.5. However, any city or county may choose to revise its source reduction and recycling element or any of its components prior to board
				  Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery
				  review of the source reduction and recycling element for the purpose of complying with this section.(2) It is further the intent of the Legislature in enacting this section to ensure that compliance with the diversion requirements of Section 41780 shall be accurately determined based upon a correlation between solid waste which was disposed of at permitted disposal facilities and diversion claims which are subsequently made for that solid waste.(b) For the purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meaning:(1) “Action by a city, county, regional, or local governing body” means franchise or contract conditions, rate or fee schedules, zoning or land use decisions, disposal facility permit conditions, or activities by a waste hauler, recycler, or disposal facility operator acting on behalf of a city, county, regional agency, or local governing body, or other action by the local governing
				  body if the local government action is specifically related to the claimed diversion.(2) “Scrap metal” includes ferrous metals, nonferrous metals, aluminum scrap, other metals, and auto bodies, but does not include aluminum cans, steel cans, or bimetal cans.(3) “Inert solids” includes rock, concrete, brick, sand, soil, fines, asphalt, and unsorted construction and demolition waste.(4) “Agricultural wastes” includes solid wastes of plant and animal origin, which result from the production and processing of farm or agricultural products, including manures, orchard and vineyard prunings, and crop residues, which are removed from the site of generation for solid waste management. Agriculture refers to SIC Codes 011 to 0291, inclusive.(c) For purposes of determining the base amount of solid waste from which the diversion requirements of this article shall be calculated, “solid waste” does not
				  include the diversion of agricultural wastes; inert solids, including inert solids used for structural fill; discarded, white-coated, major appliances; and scrap metals; unless all of the following criteria are met:(1) The city, county, or regional agency demonstrates that the material was diverted from a permitted disposal facility through an action by the city, county, or regional agency which specifically resulted in the diversion.(2) The city, county, or regional agency demonstrates that, prior to January 1, 1990, the solid waste which is claimed to have been diverted was disposed of at a permitted disposal facility in the quantity being claimed as diversion. If historical disposal data is not available, that demonstration may be based upon information available to the city, county, or regional agency which substantiates a reasonable estimate of disposal quantities which is as accurate as is feasible in the absence of historical disposal data.(3) The city, county, or regional agency is implementing, and will continue to implement, source reduction, recycling, and composting programs, as described in its source reduction and recycling element.(d) If a city, county, or regional agency source reduction and recycling element submitted pursuant to this chapter includes the diversion of any of the wastes specified in subdivision (c) for years preceding the year commencing January 1, 1990, that diversion shall not apply to the diversion requirements of Section 41780, unless the criteria in subdivision (c) are met.(e) If a city, county, or regional agency source reduction and recycling element submitted pursuant to this chapter does not contain information sufficient for the city, county, or regional agency to demonstrate to the board

				  California Integrated Waste Management Board and the state water board shall, on or before January 1, 1994, develop a work plan for combining financial assurance requirements for operating liability with financial assurance requirements for corrective actions into one mechanism which provides appropriate coverage for both purposes.Section 43050 of the Public Resources Code is amended to read:43050. (a) On or before January 1, 2008, the board California Integrated Waste Management Board shall conduct a study to define the conditions that potentially affect solid waste landfills, including technologies and engineering controls designed to mitigate potential risks, in order to identify potential long-term threats to public health and safety and the environment. The board California Integrated Waste Management Board
				  shall also study various financial assurance mechanisms that would protect the state from long-term postclosure and corrective action costs in the event that a landfill owner or operator fails to meet its legal obligations to fund postclosure maintenance or corrective action during the postclosure period. The board California Integrated Waste Management Board, on or before July 1, 2009, shall adopt regulations and develop recommendations for needed legislation to implement the findings of the study.(b) In conducting the study described in subdivision (a), the board
				  California Integrated Waste Management Board
				  shall consult with representatives of the League of California Cities, the County Supervisors Association of California, private and public waste services, and environmental organizations.Section 43101 of the Public Resources Code is amended to read:43101. The Legislature hereby finds and declares as follows:(a) The board California Integrated Waste Management Board and the state water board have submitted a report entitled Joint Report: Reforming the California Solid Waste Disposal Regulatory Process, and have recommended legislation to the Governor and the Legislature that identifies areas of regulatory overlap, conflict, and duplication and makes recommendations for change.(b) The report found that regulatory overlap, conflict, and duplication were evident between the board
				  California Integrated Waste Management Board and the state water board and between the board California Integrated Waste Management Board and local enforcement agencies and that regulatory reform was necessary to streamline the state’s solid waste disposal regulatory process. In addition, it was found that a recasting of the solid waste facilities permit was warranted to make more efficient and streamlined the permitting and regulation of solid waste disposal facilities. The report also makes numerous other appropriate recommendations for improving the manner in which the management of solid waste is regulated by the state which require immediate legislative response.(c) It is, therefore, the intent of the Legislature, in enacting this chapter, and in
				  making the necessary revisions to this division and Division 7 (commencing with Section 13000) of the Water Code by the act enacting this chapter, to accomplish all of the following:(1) As provided by Sections 40054 and 40055, the board Department of Toxics and Waste Management, the state water board, and the regional water boards shall retain their appropriate statutory authority over solid waste disposal facilities and sites. A clear and concise division of authority shall be maintained in both statute and regulation to remove all areas of overlap, duplication, and conflict between the board
				  Department of Toxics and Waste Management
				  and the state water board and regional water boards, or between the board Department of Toxics and Waste Management and any other state agency, as appropriate.(2) The state water board and regional water boards shall be the sole agencies regulating the disposal and classification of solid waste for the purpose of protecting the waters of the state, consistent with Section 40055, and the board
				  Department of Toxics and Waste Management and the certified local enforcement agencies shall regulate all other aspects of solid waste disposal within the scope of their appropriate regulatory authority.(3) To effectuate that clear division of authority, the board Department of Toxics and Waste Management and the state water board shall develop one consolidated set of solid waste disposal facility regulations where distinct chapters are written and implemented by the appropriate agency, and one consolidated permit application, including one technical report to incorporate the requirements of both the solid waste facilities permit and waste discharge requirements.(4) The process and timeframe for the review and approval of
				  the consolidated application shall be revised to allow, to the greatest extent feasible, for the concurrent development and review of the waste discharge requirements and the solid waste facilities permit. The intent of this permit streamlining effort is to shorten the overall timeframe for processing a permit and to accommodate concurrent reviews by the local enforcement agency and the regional water boards within a set timeframe.(5) Any details of a concurrent permit approval process shall be worked out in an implementation plan that is developed jointly by the board Department of Toxics and Waste Management and state water board with input from interested parties.(6) If practicable, joint inspections of facilities shall be conducted by the board
				  Department of Toxics and Waste Management, regional water boards, and local enforcement agencies, and inspection reports shall be shared with any other affected state or local agency.(7) The closure and postclosure maintenance requirements of the board Department of Toxics and Waste Management and the state water board for solid waste landfills shall be combined into one set of consolidated regulations which require one closure and postclosure maintenance plan to be prepared for each solid waste landfill.(8) A clear and concise division of responsibilities shall be maintained to minimize overlap and duplication of permitting, inspection, and compliance duties between the board
				  Department of Toxics and Waste Management and certified local enforcement agencies. The board’s
				  Department of Toxics and Waste Management’s primary role in regard to permitting and compliance shall be to provide technical assistance and ongoing training and support to local enforcement agencies, to ensure a local enforcement agency’s performance in complying with state minimum standards, and to review permits and other documents submitted by local enforcement agencies for board Department of Toxics and Waste Management concurrence or approval. The board Department of Toxics and Waste Management shall strengthen the state certification and evaluation program for local enforcement agencies
				  and shall set clear and uniform standards to be met by local enforcement agencies.(9) The Solid Waste Disposal Site Cleanup and Maintenance Account shall be abolished and a solid waste disposal fee established for deposit in the Integrated Waste Management Account which provides adequate funding for all obligations imposed pursuant to this division. In addition, the costs of the state water board and the regional water boards of regulating solid waste facilities shall be funded from the account.(10) The Solid Waste Assessment Test Program shall continue operating with resources from the Integrated Waste Management Account until all of the ranked solid waste disposal sites are reviewed.(11) Responsibility for establishing and enforcing financial responsibility requirements for solid waste landfills, from operation through to cleanup, shall, to the greatest extent practicable and consistent with applicable federal law, be
				  consolidated into one set of regulations administered by the board Department of Toxics and Waste Management, in consultation with the state water board.(12) At a minimum, the financial assurance requirements for closure and postclosure maintenance shall be combined, and the requirements for corrective action and operating liability shall be reviewed, as required by subdivision (b) of Section 43040, to determine if there can be further consolidation of financial assurance requirements for solid waste landfills.(13) The state water board or the appropriate regional water board shall have access to the financial assurance funds for closure and postclosure activities and to financial assurance funds for corrective action, as necessary, to address water quality
				  problems, if the owner or operator has failed to implement the required closure and postclosure activities or corrective action activities.(d) It is the intent of the Legislature, in enacting this chapter, and in making the necessary revisions to this division and Division 7 (commencing with Section 13000) of the Water Code, to ensure that the state minimum standards for environmental protection at solid waste disposal facilities are not reduced.Section 43103 of the Public Resources Code is amended to read:43103. The board Department of Toxics and Waste Management and the state water board shall adopt regulations for the implementation of the changes required by this chapter, and the act adding this chapter.Section 43200 of the Public Resources Code is amended to read:43200. (a) The board Department of Toxics and Waste Management shall prepare and adopt certification regulations for local enforcement agencies.

Best, or other equivalent rating by any other agency acceptable to the board
				  Department of Toxics and Waste Management.(E) If requested by the board Department of Toxics and Waste Management, an independent financial audit report evaluating the assets and liabilities of the insurance carrier and confirming compliance with the statutory and regulatory requirements of the state of domicile and an independent actuarial opinion on the independence and financial soundness of the insurance carrier by an actuary in good standing with the Casualty Actuarial Society or the American Academy of Actuaries regarding the adequacy of the loss reserves maintained by the insurance carrier shall be submitted to the board
				  Department of Toxics and Waste Management upon application and annually thereafter.(f) A solid waste facility operator using or proposing to use an insurance company to demonstrate financial assurance may be required by the board Department of Toxics and Waste Management to pay a fee for the actual and necessary cost of reviewing information submitted by the operator pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) up to an amount not to exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000), unless a higher amount is mutually agreed to by the operator and the board
				  Department of Toxics and Waste Management.(g) The funds collected pursuant to subdivision (f) shall be deposited in the Integrated Waste Management Account and shall be available, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for expenditure by the board Department of Toxics and Waste Management to fund the review specified in subdivision (f).Section 43601.5 of the Public Resources Code is amended to read:43601.5. (a) On or before March 1, 1994, the board California Integrated Waste Management Board shall review and revise regulations affecting solid waste landfill closure and postclosure financial assurances adopted in accordance with this article to make the regulations consistent with the requirements established pursuant to Subpart G (commencing with Section 258.1) of Part 258 of Subchapter I of Chapter 1 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as amended on October 9, 1991.(b) In reviewing and revising regulations pursuant to subdivision (a), the board
				  Department of Toxics and Waste Management shall, consistent with this division, and with federal law and regulations, endeavor to minimize the costs of compliance with those regulations by the owners and operators of public solid waste landfills and to provide flexible mechanisms for those owners and operators to comply with closure and postclosure financial assurance requirements, in order to ensure that adequate funding will be available for programs and projects that are necessary to comply with the diversion requirements of Section 41780.Section 43603 of the Public Resources Code is amended to read:43603. The board Department of Toxics and Waste Management shall not require an owner or operator of a disposal site to revise or amend a closure plan submitted pursuant to this section or former Section 66796.22 of the Government Code after closure of the landfill in order to reflect subsequent changes in any standards and regulations adopted by the board Department of Toxics and Waste Management.Section 43606 of the Public Resources Code is amended to read:43606. (a) Except for financial arrangements approved by the board Department of Toxics and Waste Management pursuant to this article, no indemnification, hold harmless, or similar agreement or conveyance is effective to transfer from the owner or operator of a disposal site to any other person any obligations imposed on the owner or operator under this article.(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), nothing in this section prohibits any agreement between the owner and the operator regarding their respective obligations for closure and postclosure maintenance of a disposal site, and nothing in this section prohibits a

				  greater efforts to increase the diversion of solid waste from landfills, the board Department of Toxics and Waste Management anticipates that many new transfer and processing stations and composting facilities will commence operation in California within the next two to five years.(3) To address these trends, it is necessary to provide a temporary permitting scheme to enable the operators of existing solid waste facilities to obtain temporary permits more quickly than is possible under existing law, in order to protect the public health and safety and the environment.(b) The board
				  Department of Toxics and Waste Management shall adopt emergency regulations pursuant to subdivision (d) to authorize an enforcement agency, upon the board’s Department of Toxics and Waste Management’s concurrence, to issue a temporary solid waste facilities permit to a person operating a solid waste transfer or processing station or a composting facility, that, as of January 1, 2008, is required under this division and the regulations adopted by the board Department of Toxics and Waste Management pursuant to this division to obtain a solid waste facilities permit, but for which a permit has
				  not been obtained. The regulations adopted by the board Department of Toxics and Waste Management shall include all of the following requirements:(1) That a person desiring to obtain a temporary solid waste facilities permit submit a complete and correct application for the permit to the enforcement agency having jurisdiction no later than 60 days from the effective date of the regulations.(2) That the date by which a holder of a temporary solid waste facilities permit shall obtain a permanent solid waste facilities permit from the enforcement agency having jurisdiction, or cease the activities for which a solid waste facilities permit is required, be on or before June 30, 2010.(3) That a facility covered under a temporary solid waste
