						Miller, Solorio)February 27, 2009 An act to amend Section 20395 of the Public Contract Code, relating to public contracts. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1409, as amended, John A. Perez.
											  Public contracts: county highways: work authorizations.Existing law sets forth procedures pursuant to which work being done by contract on county highways may be done. Existing law specifies that in any county that has appointed a road commissioner, or in any county that has abolished the office of road commissioner, as prescribed, the board of supervisors of the county may authorize the road commissioner, or a registered civil engineer under the direction of the county director of transportation, to have any work upon county highways done under his or her supervision and direction. In this connection, existing law provides that the work on those contracts may be done by: (1) letting a contract covering both work and material, as provided; (2) purchasing the material and letting a contract for the performance of the work, as provided; or (3) purchasing the material and having the work done by day labor, in which case advertising for bids is not required.This bill would
		revise that provision authorizing the work on those county highway contracts to be done by (1) purchasing the material and having the work done by day labor, as defined, only after advertising and requesting bids, as provided, and the board passing a resolution making a specified finding; or (2) purchasing the material and having the work done by day labor for any work classified as maintenance work, as prescribed specified employees, as defined.Digest Key

The work may be done in any of the following ways:(a) By letting a contract covering both work and material. In that event, the contract shall be let to the lowest responsible bidder as provided in this article.(b) By purchasing the material and letting a contract for the performance of the work. In that event, the material shall be bought at the lowest possible cost and the contract let to the lowest responsible bidder as provided in this article.(c) By purchasing the material and having the work done by day labor, only after advertising and requesting bids as provided in this article, and the board has passed a resolution making a finding that either no bids were received or all of the bids received exceeded the cost of having the work done by day labor. For purposes of this subdivision, “day labor” means nonpermanent, part-time, or temporary employees who are not represented by a collective bargaining unit.(d) By
				  purchasing the material and having the work done by force account.
