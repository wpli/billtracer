						John A. PerezFebruary 27, 2009 An act to amend Sections 17053.74 and 23634 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to taxation, to take effect immediately, tax levy. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1139, as amended, John A. Perez.
											  Income taxes: credits: enterprise zones.The Personal Income Tax Law and the Corporation Tax Law authorize various credits against the taxes imposed by those laws, including a credit based on “qualified wages,” which, except as specified, is that portion of wages paid or incurred by the taxpayer during the taxable year to qualified employees that does not exceed 150% of the minimum wage, for qualified taxpayers who hire qualified employees within enterprise zones, subject to specific criteria. Existing law requires a taxpayer to obtain, from specified agencies, a certification providing that a qualified employee meets the requirements of the credit. This bill would revise the definition of “qualified wages” for purposes of the credit to provide that qualified wages include that portion of wages paid or incurred by the taxpayer that do not exceed ____% of the
		minimum wage and to further revise the definition to provide that qualified wages include that portion of wages paid or incurred by the taxpayer that do not exceed ____% of the minimum wage for qualified employees that the qualified employer employs for at least 35 hours per week and for whom the taxpayer pays for at least 80% of specified forms of health care coverage. This bill would also revise the definition of “qualified employee” by removing, as an element of eligibility as a qualified employee, residency in a targeted employment or targeted tax area. Additionally, this bill would require taxpayers to apply for, and obtain, the certification of a qualified employee within 21 days of the date of hire of the qualified employee. This bill would also require taxpayers to annually report specified information regarding qualified employees to certifying agencies which then must compile and report that information to the Department of Housing and Community Development, for an annual report presented by the
		department to the Legislature. The Personal Income Tax Law and the Corporation Tax Law authorize various credits against the taxes imposed by those laws, including a hiring credit for qualified taxpayers who hire qualified employees, as defined, within enterprise zones, subject to specific criteria. Qualified employees includes, for purposes of the credit, an ex-offender, as defined.This bill would revise the definition of “qualified employee” for this purpose, by providing that an ex-offender includes an individual who has been convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor offense punishable by incarceration, or a person charged with a felony or misdemeanor punishable by incarceration but placed on probation without a finding of guilt, with specified exclusions. This bill would also make technical, nonsubstantive changes to remove obsolete references in the credit provisions.This bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy.Digest Key
