						LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1546, Committee on Revenue and Taxation.
										Taxation: limited partnerships: income tax: dependent exemption credit: corporation tax apportionment.(1) The Personal Income Tax Law and the Corporation Tax Law impose various taxes, and provide for various credits and penalties and for apportionment of income.This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to provisions of personal and corporation income tax laws relating to penalties, dependent exemption credit, and apportionment of income. (2) Existing law sets forth rules of organization and governance for limited partnerships. Current law allows a canceled domestic limited partnership to revive by accompanying a certificate of revival, filed with the Secretary of State, with specified information confirmed by the Franchise Tax Board, including confirmation that all taxes owed by the partnership have been paid to the Franchise Tax Board.This bill would require the partnership, on or after January 1, 2010, to accompany the certificate of revival with written confirmation, obtained from the
		Franchise Tax Board, that all required tax returns have been filed by the partnership. This bill would further authorize the Franchise Tax Board to assess a specialized tax service fee of $100 for a limited partnership revival confirmation letter request, until January 1, 2011, after which the amount of the fee would be set by regulation.Existing income tax laws require specified individuals to pay estimated income taxes in installments and impose additional liability for underpayments.This bill would adjust the amount of those installments under specified circumstances.

                                NO  Bill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. Section 15902.09 of the Corporations Code is amended to read:15902.09. (a) A domestic limited partnership whose certificate of limited partnership has been canceled pursuant to Section 15902.03 may be revived by filing with, and on a form prescribed by, the Secretary of State a certificate of revival. The certificate of revival shall be accompanied by written confirmation by the Franchise Tax Board that all of the following have occurred:(1) All of the following have been paid to the Franchise Tax Board:(A) The annual tax due under Section 17935 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.(B) All fees,
				  penalties, and interest for each year for which the domestic limited partnership failed to pay such annual tax, including each year between the cancellation of its certificate of limited partnership and its revival.(2) All required tax returns have been filed, including returns for each taxable year between the cancellation of its certificate of limited partnership and its revival.(b) The certificate of revival shall set forth all of the following:(1) The name of the limited partnership at the time its certificate of limited partnership was canceled, and if the name is not available at the time of revival, the name under which the limited partnership is to be revived.(2) The date of filing of the original certificate of limited partnership.(3) The address of the limited partnership’s designated office.(4) The name and address of the initial agent for service of process in accordance with paragraph (1) of subdivision (d) of Section 15901.16.(5) A statement that the certificate of revival is filed by one or more general partners of the limited partnership authorized to execute and file the certificate of revival to revive the limited partnership.(6) The Secretary of State’s file number for the original limited partnership.(7) The name and address of each general partner.(8) Any other matters the general partner or partners executing the certificate of revival determine to include therein.(c) The certificate of revival should be deemed to be an amendment to the certificate of limited partnership, and the limited partnership shall not be required to take any further action to amend its certificate of limited partnership pursuant to Section 15902.02 with respect to the matter set forth in the certificate of revival.(d) Upon the filing of the certificate of revival, the limited partnership shall be revived with the same force and effect as if the certificate of limited partnership had not been canceled pursuant to Section 15902.03. The revival shall validate all contracts, acts, matters, and things made, done, and performed by the limited partnership, its partners, employees, and agents following the time its certificate of limited
				  partnership was canceled pursuant to Section 15902.03 with the same force and effect and all intents and purposes as if the certificate of limited partnership had remained in full force and effect. This provision shall apply provided that third parties are relying on the acts of the partnership, its partners, employees, and agents. All real and personal property, and all rights and interests, that belong to a limited partnership at the time its certificate of limited partnership was canceled pursuant to Section 15902.03 or that were acquired by the limited partnership following the cancellation of the certificate of limited partnership, that were not disposed of prior to the time of its revival, shall be vested in the limited partnership after its revival as fully as if they were held by the limited partnership at, and during the time after, as the case may be, the time the certificate of limited partnership was canceled. After its revival, the limited partnership and its partners shall have all of the same
				  liability for contracts, acts, matters, and things made, done, or performed in the limited partnership’s name and on behalf of its partners, employees, and agents, as the limited partnership and its partners would have had if the limited partnership’s certificate of limited partnership had at all times remained in full force and effect.(e) The amendments made to this section by the act adding this subdivision shall apply to written confirmations made by the Franchise Tax Board on or after January 1, 2010.SEC. 2. Section 17054 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to read:17054. In the case of individuals, the following credits for personal exemption may be deducted from the tax imposed under Section 17041 or 17048, less any increases imposed under paragraph (1) of subdivision (d) or paragraph (1) of subdivision (e), or both, of Section 17560.(a) In the case of a single individual, a head of household, or a married individual making a separate return, a credit of fifty-two dollars ($52).(b) In the case of a surviving spouse (as defined in Section 17046), or a husband and wife making a joint return, a credit of one hundred four dollars ($104).

				  for each dependent shall be equal to the amount that would be allowed if subparagraph (A) had never been operative.(e) A credit for personal exemption of fifty-two dollars ($52) for the taxpayer if he or she is blind at the end of his or her taxable year.(f) A credit for personal exemption of fifty-two dollars ($52) for the spouse of the taxpayer if a separate return is made by the taxpayer, and if the spouse is blind and, for the calendar year in which the taxable year of the taxpayer begins, has no gross income and is not the dependent of another taxpayer.(g) For the purposes of this section, an individual is blind only if either (1) his or her central visual acuity does not exceed 20/200 in the better eye with correcting lenses, or (2) his or her visual acuity is greater than 20/200 but is accompanied by a
				  limitation in the fields of vision such that the widest diameter of the visual field subtends an angle no greater than 20 degrees.(h) In the case of an individual with respect to whom a credit under this section is allowable to another taxpayer for a taxable year beginning in the calendar year in which the individual’s taxable year begins, the credit amount applicable to that individual for that individual’s taxable year is zero.(i) For each taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 1989, the Franchise Tax Board shall compute the credits prescribed in this section.
