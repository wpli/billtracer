						Hill)February 27, 2009 An act to amend Section 38505 of, and to add Section 38573 to, the Health and Safety Code, relating to air pollution. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1404, De Leon.
											  California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006: offsets. The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 designates the State Air Resources Board as the state agency charged with monitoring and regulating sources of emissions of greenhouse gases. The state board is required to adopt a statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit equivalent to the statewide greenhouse gas emissions level in 1990 to be achieved by 2020, and to adopt rules and regulations in an open public process to achieve the maximum technologically feasible and cost-effective greenhouse gas emission reductions. The act authorizes the state board to adopt by regulation, after a public workshop, a schedule of fees to be paid by the sources of greenhouse gas emissions regulated pursuant to the act. The fee revenues are deposited into the Air Pollution Control Fund and are available, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for purposes of carrying out the act. The state board is authorized to adopt market-based compliance mechanisms, as defined, meeting
		specified requirements to be used for compliance with those regulations. The state board is required, before including any market-based compliance mechanism, to maximize additional environmental and economic benefits for California, as appropriate. This bill would require the state board, if the state board allows the use of market-based compliance mechanisms, to limit the use of compliance offsets, as defined, that meet specific criteria, to no more than 10% of the greenhouse gas emission reductions expected from market mechanisms during the compliance period. The bill would require the state board to apply the limit as a percentage of each regulated party’s reported emissions in a compliance period. The bill would require the state board to impose an administrative fee pursuant to the fee authority described above for deposit into the fund to pay for expenses related to state board administration of the compliance offset program, upon
		appropriation by the Legislature. This bill would incorporate changes to Section 38505 of the Health and Safety Code proposed by both this bill and SB 104, which would become operative only if both bills are enacted and this bill is enacted after SB 104.Digest Key

Statewide emissions shall be expressed in tons of carbon dioxide equivalents.(o) “Statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit” or “statewide emissions limit” means the maximum allowable level of statewide greenhouse gas emissions in 2020, as determined by the state board pursuant to Part 3 (commencing with Section 38550).SEC. 1.5. Section 38505 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:38505. For the purposes of this division, the following terms have the following meanings:(a) “Allowance” means an authorization to emit, during a specified year, up to one ton of carbon dioxide equivalent.(b) “Alternative compliance mechanism” means an action undertaken by a greenhouse gas emission source that achieves the equivalent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions over the same time period as a direct emission reduction, and that is approved by the state board. “Alternative compliance mechanism” includes, but is not limited to, a flexible compliance schedule, alternative control technology, a process change, or a product substitution.(c) “Carbon dioxide equivalent” means the amount of carbon dioxide by weight that would produce the same global warming impact as a given weight of another greenhouse gas, based on the best available science, including from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.(d) “Cost-effective” or “cost-effectiveness” means the cost per unit of reduced emissions of greenhouse gases adjusted for its global warming potential.(e) “Compliance offset” means a quantified reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases in a sector different from the sector or sectors regulated by a greenhouse gas emission limit for which a market-based compliance mechanism has been adopted by the state board, that is used for compliance of that greenhouse gas emission limit by a greenhouse gas emission source regulated by that limit.(f) “Direct emission reduction” means a greenhouse gas emission reduction action made by a greenhouse gas emission source at that source.(g) “Emissions reduction measure” means programs, measures, standards, and alternative compliance mechanisms authorized pursuant to this division, applicable to sources or categories of sources, that are designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.(h) “Greenhouse gas” or “greenhouse gases” includes all of the following gases:(1) Carbon dioxide.(2) Methane.(3) Nitrous oxide.(4) Hydrofluorocarbons.(5) Perfluorocarbons.(6) Sulfur hexafluoride.(7) Nitrogen trifluoride.(i) “Greenhouse gas emissions limit” means an authorization, during a specified year, to emit up to a level of greenhouse gases specified by the state board, expressed in tons of carbon dioxide equivalents.(j) “Greenhouse gas emission source” or “source” means any source, or category of sources, of greenhouse gas emissions whose emissions are at a level of significance, as determined by the state board, that its participation in the program established under this division will enable the state board to effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions and monitor compliance with the statewide greenhouse gas emissions
