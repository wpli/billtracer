						LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1293, Hall.
											  Public school employees: merit system.Existing law requires all vacancies in the classified service of a school district that has adopted the merit system to be filled from applicants on eligibility lists that are made up from promotional examinations or other specified methods. Existing law requires that if a vacancy is filled from applicants on an eligibility list, the appointment is to be made from the eligible candidates having the first 3 ranks on the list.Existing law, until January 1, 2012, in a school district with a pupil population over 400,000, authorizes an appointment to be made from other than the first 3 ranks on the eligibility list if specialized licenses, certifications, knowledge, or ability that cannot reasonably be acquired during the probationary period or a specific gender is required for successful job performance of a position, in which case the appointment is required to be made from among the highest 3 ranks of applicants on the
		list who meet the special requirements. Existing law makes these provisions apply only to specified classifications of positions and to classifications that have been designated as management.This bill would make these provisions applicable to the classifications of accountant, contract assistant, coordinating contract assistant, assistant contracts supervisor, senior administrative analyst, senior financial analyst, senior administrative assistant, principal financial analyst, and principal administrative analyst.
