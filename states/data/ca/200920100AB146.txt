						MendozaJanuary 22, 2009 An act to amend Section 60061.5 of the Education Code, relating to instructional materials. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 146, Mendoza.
											  Instructional materials: delivery.Existing law requires the State Board of Education to adopt basic instructional materials for use in kindergarten and grades 1 to 8, inclusive. Every publisher or manufacturer of instructional materials offered for adoption or sale in California is required to comply with certain requirements, including guaranteeing delivery of textbooks and instructional materials prior to the opening of school in the year in which the textbooks and instructional materials are to be used if they are ordered by a date or dates specified in the contract with the district.This bill would require a publisher or manufacturer of instructional materials offered for adoption or sale in California to guarantee delivery, if applicable, by the date specified in the contract with the district and would make a publisher or manufacturer that fails to deliver instructional materials within 60 days of the receipt of a purchase order from a school
		district liable for damages in the amount of $500 for each working day that the order is delayed beyond 60 calendar days unless there is a natural disaster, terrorist attack, act of war, or worker strike that prevents the normal transit of instructional materials, resulting in their late delivery, or if there is a delay in implementation of governing board requirements, as specified. This requirement would apply only to contracts with districts enrolling 25,000 or fewer pupils. Digest Key
