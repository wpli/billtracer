						DeVore, Jeffries, Nestande, Silva)February 27, 2009An act to amend Section 9088 of, and to add Section 13281.5 to, the An act to amend Section 9088 of the Elections Code, relating to elections. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1278, as amended, Harkey.
											  Elections: initiatives.Existing law requires that ballot labels for state measures voted on at elections contain specified information. Existing law requires the Legislative Analyst to prepare a discussion of the state’s current bonded indebtedness for the ballot pamphlet at a statewide general election in which a state bond measure is submitted for voter approval.This bill would require the Legislative Analyst to include additional information in the ballot pamphlet for an election for each state initiative measure that proposes the issuance of a state bond. The bill also would require that the ballot labels for those state bond measures include additional information relating to the proposed bond.Because the bill would require local elections officials to provide additional information for state bond measures on election ballots, it would impose a state-mandated local program.The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.Digest Key
