											  Product management: single-use recyclable packaging containers. Waste management.Existing law creates the California Integrated Waste Management Board with specified powers and duties.Chapter 21 of the Statutes of 2009, which will go into effect on January 1, 2010, will abolish the California Integrated Waste Management Board and transfer its duties and responsibilities to the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, which Chapter 21 of the Statutes of 2009 will create in the Natural Resources Agency, under the direction of an executive officer known as the Director of Resources Recycling and Recovery. Chapter 21 of the Statutes of 2009 will authorize the director to accept on behalf of the department federal grants, and will require the grants to be deposited in the Special Deposit Fund, which is continuously appropriated.Under existing law, the Department of Conservation
		administers the California Beverage Container Recycling and Litter Reduction Act.Chapter 21 of the Statutes of 2009 will transfer those duties to the Division of Recycling that Chapter 21 of the Statutes of 2009 will establish within the newly created Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery.Existing law establishes the Office of Education and the Environment in the California Integrated Waste Management Board.Chapter 21 of the Statutes of 2009 will transfer the Office of Education and the Environment to the California Environmental Protection Agency.This bill would delay the operative date of the changes made by Chapter 21 of the Statutes of 2009 to January 1, 2011.The California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989, administered by the California Integrated Waste Management Board, prohibits a person from selling a food or beverage container in this state that is labeled with the term “compostable” or “marine degradable,” unless the food or beverage container meets certain requirements.This bill, on and after July 1, 2014, would prohibit a retail establishment or retailer, as defined, from selling, distributing, or importing in commerce a single-use recyclable packaging container, as defined, that is comprised predominantly of polyvinyl chloride plastic resin.Digest Key
