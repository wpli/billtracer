						HarkeyDeVoreHarkeySilvaFebruary 27, 2009An act relating to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. An act to amend Section 30106 of the Public Resources Code, relating to coastal resources, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately.LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1253, as amended, Fuller Harkey.
											  Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta: fish predation report. Coastal resources: California Coastal Act of 1976: development: fireworks displays.The California Coastal Act of 1976 provides for the planning and regulation of development, under a coastal development permit process, within the coastal zone. Existing law defines development for these purposes.This bill would provide that “development” does not include a fireworks display conducted by a public entity.This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.The California Bay-Delta Authority Act establishes in the Natural Resources Agency the California Bay-Delta Authority. The act requires the authority and the implementing agencies to carry out programs, projects, and activities necessary to implement the Bay-Delta Program, defined to mean those projects, programs, commitments, and other actions that address the goals and objectives of the CALFED Bay-Delta Programmatic Record of Decision, dated August 28, 2000, or as it may be amended. The act requires the authority to establish a board of independent scientists to advise and make recommendations to the authority and the Bay-Delta Public Advisory Committee, as appropriate, on the science relative to implementation of all program elements, including the science program element.This bill would require the CALFED science program staff to conduct an independent scientific review of existing literature and studies on fish predation in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, and to prepare and submit to the Legislature and the Governor a prescribed report.The bill would also authorize the Natural Resources Agency, or a successor agency, to enter into funding agreements with public agencies and nongovernmental organizations to pay for the cost of the independent scientific review.Digest Key

				  construction, reconstruction, demolition, or alteration of the size of any structure, including any facility of any private, public, or municipal utility; and the removal or harvesting of major vegetation other than for agricultural purposes, kelp harvesting, and timber operations which are in accordance with a timber harvesting plan submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Z’berg-Nejedly Forest Practice Act of 1973 (Chapter 8 (commencing with Section 4511) of Part 2 of Division 4).As (b) As

		  management actions that could reduce the effects of predation. The review shall also include an evaluation of existing studies on fish salvage methods and other mitigation protocols at state and federal pumping facilities and recommendations for changes in methodologies to improve survival, including the projected costs of those changes.(b)After completing the review required by subdivision (a), the CALFED science program staff shall prepare and submit to the Legislature and the Governor a report that
		  includes the following:(1)A recommendation on whether additional studies are needed.(2)If the CALFED science program staff recommends additional studies, recommendations for the design and scope of those studies and an estimate of the total costs for the studies.(3)A determination of whether predator species are adversely affecting indigenous pelagic species at a population level.(4)Possible policy changes and management actions to mitigate or reduce the effects of predation, if determined to
		  have an adverse population level impact, and the projected costs of those actions.(c)The Natural Resources Agency, or its successor agency, may enter into funding agreements with public agencies and nongovernmental organizations to pay for the cost of the independent scientific review specified in subdivision (a).
