						SalasFebruary 27, 2009 An act to amend Section 107.4 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to taxation. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1332, as amended, Salas.
											  Taxation: military housing.Existing property tax law requires that all property subject to tax be assessed at its full value, and includes certain possessory interests among those property interests that are subject to tax. Existing property tax law defines a taxable possessory interest to be a use that is independent, durable, and exclusive. Existing property tax law specifies that, for purposes of the definition of a taxable possessory interest, a possession or use is not independent if it is pursuant to a contract that includes, but is not limited to, a long-term lease for the private construction, renovation, rehabilitation, replacement, management, or maintenance of housing for active duty military personnel and their dependents, if the housing units and the private contractor constructing the housing meet specified criteria. Existing law specifies that one of these criteria is a requirement that any reduction, as specified, in property taxes on leased property used for military
		housing, as defined, inures solely to the benefit of the residents of the military housing through improvements.This bill would delete the requirement that the housing be for military personnel and their dependents and instead specify that the housing be for military personnel or their dependents or both. This bill would clarify that, for the purposes of the definition of a taxable possessory interest, any reduction, as specified, in property taxes on leased property used for military housing, as defined, would inure solely to the benefit of the residents of the military housing through improvements, including community improvements, as specified, and housing improvements, as specified, and the renovation and refurbishment of those improvements. This bill would authorize the private contractor to use the reasonable estimate of property tax savings to construct, or to secure financing for the construction of, the community and housing improvements to be constructed
		as part of the initial construction of the project, as defined. This bill would authorize the private contractor and the county assessor to agree to extend the time for the initial construction of the project, as specified. This bill would extend the time period the county assessor may make an escape assessment, as specified, by a period equal to the extension of the initial construction period agreed upon by the county assessor and the private contractor. This bill would require the private contractor to submit specified information to the county assessor, as provided, and would require the private contractor’s response that was accepted by the military, and the binding project documents, for certain leases, to include specified information.Digest Key

Specifically, that if the tax savings for a given assessment year are not expended through constructed improvements within the time period that the county assessor may make an escape assessment for that assessment year, the requirement of subdivision (m) of Section 107.4 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, as amended by this act, is not satisfied. Further, in any hearing involving the appeal of an escape assessment made by the county assessor for a failure to satisfy the requirements of that subdivision (m) of Section 107.4, the county assessor shall have
		  rebutted the presumption affecting the burden of proof in favor of the taxpayer or assessee under subdivision (a) of Section 167 of the Revenue and Taxation Code by submitting a statement that, to the best of his or her knowledge, the requirements of Section 107.4 have not been satisfied. Except as provided by this section, the amendments made to Section 107.4 of the Revenue and Taxation Code by this act shall not be construed as limiting the ability of the county assessor and a taxpayer from extending the period of time within which to make an escape assessment under Section 532.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.
