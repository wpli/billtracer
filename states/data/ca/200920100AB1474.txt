						CookFebruary 27, 2009 An act to add Section 6376.4 to and repeal Section 6376.4 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to taxation, to take effect immediately, tax levy.LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1474, as amended, Cook.
											  Sales and use taxes: exemption: fixed price contract: mobilehome.The Sales and Use Tax Law imposes a sales tax on a retailer measured by the gross receipts from the retail sale in this state of tangible personal property and a use tax on the storage, use, or other consumption in this state of tangible personal property purchased from a retailer for storage, use, or other consumption in this state measured by sales price. Existing law increases the state sales and use tax rate on the sale of, and on the storage, use, or other consumption of, tangible personal property, by 1% to a rate of 71/4% from April 1, 2009, until July 1, 2012, 2011, as provided.The Sales and Use Tax law also provides that a
		person who is a retailer of mobilehomes, including manufactured homes, who sells a new mobilehome to a purchaser for occupancy as a residence shall pay use tax at the time of its sale to the purchaser, measured by an amount equal to 75% of the price the retailer paid for the new mobilehome. This bill would provide that the 1% rate of tax increase does not apply to the gross receipts from the sale of a new mobilehome, or the sales price of a new mobilehome sold or stored, used, or otherwise consumed in this state, if specified conditions are met.The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill
		would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.This bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy.Digest Key
