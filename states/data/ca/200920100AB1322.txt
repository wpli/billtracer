						Ashburn)February 27, 2009 An act to add Section 9084.1 to the Elections Code, and to amend Section 84506.5 of the Government Code, relating 84207 to the Government Code, relating to the Political Reform Act of 1974, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take effect immediately. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1322, as amended, Huffman.
											  Political Reform Act of 1974: campaign contributions: disclosures.Existing law, the Political Reform Act of 1974 (the PRA), requires that an advertisement supporting or opposing a candidate that is paid for by an independent expenditure committee contain a statement that the advertisement was not authorized by the candidate. Under existing law, a knowing or willful violation of the PRA is a misdemeanor.This bill would require that the advertisement identify the name of the independent expenditure committee that purchased it and would, for specified advertisements,
		additionally require that the disclosure statement identify an Internet Web site address where the committee’s donors are listed. Committees that are required to file electronically with the Secretary of State would be required to list the Secretary of State’s Internet Web site address on their disclosure statements, and a committee that is not required to register
		electronically
		would be required to include a Uniform Resource Locator for an Internet Web site address that identifies the committee’s principal officer and lists the information on donors who have contributed $100 or more to the committee, as specified. The bill would authorize the Secretary of State to include information on how voters can determine who is funding campaigns and campaign-related communications on the ballot pamphlet, as long as it can be included without increasing the number of pages
		and to include a statement describing the types of campaign contributions, applicable contribution limits, and the role of independent expenditures.Because the bill by adding requirements to the PRA, the violation of which is a crime, would expand the definition of a crime, it would impose a state-mandated local program.Existing law, the Political Reform Act of 1974, requires reporting of contributions made to a candidate for elective state office. Certain contributions are required to be reported to the Secretary of State within 24 hours.This bill would require the Governor or a Member of the Legislature during a specified state budget time period or a specified period before or after the end of the first year or 2nd year of a legislative
		session to file online a report disclosing a separate contribution exceeding $1,000 within 24 hours of the time the contribution is received. The bill would require the Fair Political Practices Commission to issue a reporting calendar by January 15 of each year which delineates the new reporting periods.Existing law makes a violation of the act subject to administrative, civil, and criminal penalties.By subjecting persons who violate these provisions to criminal penalties, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that no
		reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.The Political Reform Act of 1974, an initiative measure, provides that the Legislature may amend the act to further the act’s purposes upon a 2/3 vote of each house and compliance with specified procedural requirements.This bill would declare that it furthers the purposes of the act.This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.Digest Key
