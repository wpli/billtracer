LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1564, as introduced, Committee on Insurance.
										Workers’ compensation.(1) Existing law establishes a workers’ compensation system, administered by the Administrative Director of the Division of Workers’ Compensation, which requires employers to secure the payment of workers’ compensation, including medical treatment, for injuries incurred by their employees that arise out of, or in the course of, employment.Existing law authorizes collective bargaining agreements between a private employer or groups of employers engaged in construction-related activities and a recognized or certified exclusive bargaining representative that establishes, among other things, a vocational rehabilitation or retraining program utilizing an agreed list of providers of rehabilitation services that may be the exclusive source of providers of rehabilitation services.This bill would delete the provision providing that a collective bargaining
		agreement may establish a vocational rehabilitation or retraining program and would make conforming changes.(2) Existing law authorizes labor‑management agreements between an employer or groups of employers and a union that is the recognized or certified exclusive bargaining representative regarding various issues that are negotiated separate and apart from any collective bargaining agreement covering affected employees. The labor-management agreements may establish an alternative dispute resolution system, use of an agreed list of providers of medical treatment that may be the exclusive source of all workers’ compensation medical treatment, the use of an agreed, limited list of qualified medical evaluators that may be used exclusively for workers’ compensation purposes, joint labor management safety committees, a light‑duty modified job, or return‑to‑work program, or a vocation rehabilitation or retraining program that may be used exclusively
		for workers’ compensation purposes. This bill would delete the provision providing that the labor-management agreement may include a vocation rehabilitation or retraining program and would make conforming changes.(3) Existing law provides that each inmate of a state penal or correctional institution shall be entitled to workers’ compensation benefits for injury arising out of, and in the course of, assigned employment and for the death of the inmate if the injury proximately causes the death, subject to specified conditions. Existing law provides that an employee who is an inmate, as defined, who is eligible for vocational rehabilitation, as defined, shall only be eligible for direct placement services.This bill would delete the provision limiting eligibility to direct placement services.(4) Existing workers’ compensation law requires the treating physician primarily responsible for managing the care of an injured worker, or a physician designated by the treating physician, to render opinions on all medical issues necessary to determine eligibility for compensation.This bill would provide that no disputed medical issue, as specified, shall be the subject of declaration of readiness to proceed to a hearing unless there has been an evaluation by the treating physician or agreed or qualified medical evaluator.(5) Existing law provides that if an employer objects to a report of the treating physician recommending that spinal surgery be performed, an orthopedic surgeon or neurosurgeon shall prepare a second opinion report resolving the disputed surgical recommendation, as specified. Existing law provides
		that if the second opinion report does not recommend surgery, the employer shall file a declaration of readiness to proceed.This bill would provide that if the second opinion does not recommend surgery, the employer shall file a declaration of readiness to proceed, unless the employee agrees in writing with the recommendation of the second opinion physician.(6) Existing law provides that if a qualified medical evaluator selected from a panel of evaluators fails to complete the formal medical evaluation within the timeframes established by the Administrative Director of the Division of Workers’ Compensation, a new evaluation may be obtained, upon the request of either party. This bill would require that a new evaluation may only be obtained if the party requests the new evaluation prior to the receipt of the evaluator’s report.(7) Existing law provides that neither the employee nor the employer shall have any liability for payment for the formal medical evaluation that was not completed within the required timeframes unless the employee or employer, on prescribed forms, each then waives the right to a new evaluation and elects to accept the original evaluation even though it was not completed within the required timeframes.This bill would, instead, provide that neither the employee nor the employer shall have any liability if either party objects to the report prior to receipt of the report and that if neither objects, each then waives the right to a new evaluation and elects to accept the original evaluation.(8) Existing law provides that where an asbestos worker, as defined, is injured as a result of asbestosis, as defined, and makes a claim for workers’
		compensation, if the responsible employer cannot be located or fails to provider workers’ compensation within 30 days, the worker may seek the payment of workers’ compensation temporary disability and medical benefits from the continuously appropriated Asbestos Workers’ Account in the Uninsured Employers Fund in the State Treasury. Existing law provides that once a decision establishing the responsible employer or insurance carrier is agreed upon between the parties, or is issued by the Workers’ Compensation Appeals Board, and becomes final, the Asbestos Workers’ Account shall terminate payment of compensation benefits, notify all interested parties accordingly, and seek reimbursement for the benefits the account paid out.(9) Existing law provides that the above provisions shall be operative only until January 1, 1989, and as of that date all payments from the fund shall be terminated, and the state shall have no further obligation to pay
		asbestos workers’ benefits, unless a later enacted act that is chaptered before January 1, 1989, deletes or extends that date. Existing law provides, however, that if no statute is enacted to delete or extend that date prior to January 1, 1989, the authority of the Asbestos Workers’ Account to recover the benefits and costs paid to asbestos workers prior to that date shall continue until the benefits and costs have been recovered.This bill would delete the above provisions.(10) Under existing law, the employee, or the dependents of a deceased employee, shall be reimbursed for his or her medical-legal expenses, as defined. Existing law provides that, except as provided, no comprehensive medical-legal evaluations, except those at the request of the employer, shall be performed during the first 60 days after the notice of claim has been filed, and neither the employer nor the employee shall be liable
		for any expenses incurred for comprehensive medical-legal evaluations performed within the first 60 days after the notice of claim has been filed.This bill would, instead, provide that neither the employer nor the employee shall be liable for any medical-legal expenses incurred outside of specified provisions.(11) Existing law requires that a disability indemnity payment made by any written instrument be immediately negotiable and payable in cash on demand. Existing law provides that an employer may deposit the disability indemnity payment in an account in any bank, savings and loan association, or credit union of the employee’s choice in California, provided the employee has voluntarily authorized the deposit.This bill would no longer authorize an employer to deposit the disability indemnity payment in an account in a savings and loan association.(12) Under the workers’ compensation system, the Workers’ Compensation Appeals Board has jurisdiction to determine claims by employees who have sustained injuries in the course of his or her employment.Existing law prohibits petitions filed with the appeals board concerning a continuing temporary disability award from being granted while the injured worker is pursuing a rehabilitation plan. This bill would delete the above provision.(13) Existing workers’ compensation law authorizes the appeals board to determine and allow specified expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees for legal services, as liens against any sum to be paid as compensation. Existing law prohibits a fee for legal services from being awarded to any representative who is not an attorney, except with respect to those claims
		for compensation for which an application, as specified, has been filed with the appeals board on or before December 31, 1991, or for which a disclosure form, as specified, has been sent to the employer, or insurer or 3rd-party administrator, if either is known, on or before December 31, 1991.This bill would, instead, prohibit a fee for legal services from being awarded to any representative who is not an attorney and would no longer provide for an exception.(14) Existing law prohibits a lien claim for reasonable expenses incurred by or on behalf of the injured employee and medical-legal expenses from being filed after 6 months from the date on which the appeals board or a workers’ compensation administrative law judge issues a final decision, findings, order, including an order approving compromise and release, or award, on the merits of the claim, after 5 years from the date of the injury for which
		the services were provided, or after one year from the date the services were provided, whichever is later.(15) Existing law provides that where it appears in any proceeding pending before the appeals board that a lien should be allowed if it had been duly requested by the party entitled thereto, the appeals board may, without any request for the lien having been made, order the payment of the claim to be made directly to the person entitled, as specified.This bill would prohibit the appeals board from ordering the payment of the claim if the party entitled to it did not comply with the 6-month timeframe relating to reasonable expenses incurred by or on behalf of the injured employee and medical-legal expenses.(16) Existing law requires the workers’ compensation judge at each district office to prepare a list of all eligible attorneys
		who apply to be placed on the list of eligible arbitrators. Existing law prohibits an attorney from being included in the panel of arbitrators if he or she has served as a judge in any proceeding involving the same case.This bill would authorize the parties to the case to waive the prohibition of an attorney who had served as a judge in any proceeding involving the same case.(17) Under existing law, when a workers’ compensation dispute is submitted for arbitration, the workers’ compensation judge is required to add certain arbitrators to the arbitration panel depending upon the composition of the parties in the case.This bill would provide that when an applicant or lien claimant is a party to the relevant claim, for each additional party in the capacity of employer, the presiding judge shall assign a retired workers’ compensation judge or retired appeals
		board commissioner and an applicant’s attorney to the arbitration panel. The bill would provide that when the dispute involves solely defendants, for each additional party in the capacity of employer beyond 2 employers, the presiding judge shall assign a workers’ compensation judge or retired appeals board commissioner and an applicant’s attorney.(18) Existing law specifies locations where a workers’ compensation claim may be filed. Under existing law, if the venue site where the application is to be filed is the county where the employee’s attorney maintains his or her principal business, the attorney for the employee shall indicate that venue site when forwarding a information request form. Existing law provides the employer with 30 days from receipt of the information request form to object to the selected venue site.This bill would, instead, provide that if the venue site where the application is
		to be filed is the county where the employee’s attorney maintains his or her principal business, the employer shall have 30 days from receipt of the conforming application, as defined, to file and serve an objection to the selected venue site.(19) Existing law requires all oral testimony, objections, and rulings at all hearings and investigations before the appeals board or a workers’ compensation judge to be taken down in shorthand by a competent phonographic reporter.This bill would, instead, require all oral testimony, objections, and rulings to be recorded on a permanent accessible record by a competent hearing reporter.Digest Key

If, during the pendency of any claim wherein the employee or his or her
				  dependents has made an election to proceed against one or more employers, it should appear that there is another proper party not yet joined, the additional party shall be joined as a defendant by the appeals board on the motion of any party in interest, but the liability of the employer shall not be determined until supplemental proceedings are instituted. Any employer joined as a defendant subsequent to the first hearing or subsequent to the election provided herein shall not be entitled to participate either in any of the proceedings prior to the appeal board’s final decision, nor or to any continuance or further proceedings, but may be permitted to ascertain from the employee or his or her dependents such
				  the information as that will enable the employer to determine the time, place, and duration of the alleged employment. On supplemental proceedings, however, the right of the employer to full and complete examination or cross-examination shall not be restricted.(d) (1) In the event a self-insured employer which owns and operates a work location in the State of California, sells or has sold the ownership and operation of the work location pursuant to a sale of a business or all or part of the assets of a business to another self-insured person or entity after January 1, 1974, but before January 1, 1978, and all the requirements of subparagraphs (A) to (D), inclusive, exist, then the liability of the
				  employer-seller and employer-buyer, respectively, for cumulative injuries suffered by employees employed at the work location immediately before the sale shall, until January 1, 1986, be governed by the provisions of this section which were in effect on the date of that sale.(A) The sale constitutes a material change in ownership of such the work location.(B) The person or entity making the purchase continues the operation of the work location.(C) The person or entity becomes the employer of substantially all of the employees of the employer-seller.(D) The
				  agreement of sale makes no special provision for the allocation of liabilities for workers’ compensation between the buyer and the seller.(2) For purposes of this subdivision:(A) “Work location” shall mean any fixed place of business, office, or plant where employees regularly work in the trade or business of the employer.(B) A “material change in ownership” shall mean a change in ownership whereby the employer-seller does not retain, directly or indirectly, through one or more corporate entities, associations, trusts, partnerships, joint ventures, or family members, a controlling interest in the work location.(3) This subdivision shall have no force or effect on or after January 1, 1986, unless otherwise extended by the Legislature prior to that
				  date, and it shall not have any force or effect as respects an employee who, subsequent to the sale described in paragraph (1) and prior to the date of his or her application for compensation benefits has been filed, is transferred to a different work location by the employer-buyer.(4) If any provision of this subdivision or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, that invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of this subdivision which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this subdivision are severable.(e) At any time within one year after the appeals board has made an award for compensation benefits in connection with an occupational disease or cumulative injury, any employer held liable under the award may institute proceedings before the appeals board for the
				  purpose of determining an apportionment of liability or right of contribution. The proceeding shall not diminish, restrict, or alter in any way the recovery previously allowed the employee or his or her dependents, but shall be limited to a determination of the respective contribution rights, interest or liabilities of all the employers joined in the proceeding, either initially or supplementally; provided, however,. However, if the appeals board finds on supplemental proceedings for the purpose of determining an apportionment of liability or of a right of contribution that an employer previously held liable in fact has no liability, it may dismiss the employer and amend its original award in such manner as may be required.(f) If any proceeding before the
				  appeals board for the purpose of determining an apportionment of liability or of a right of contribution where any employee incurred a disability or death resulting from silicosis in underground metal mining operations, the determination of the respective rights and interests of all of the employers joined in the proceedings either initially or supplementally shall be as follows:(1) All employers whose underground metal mining operations resulted in a silicotic exposure during the period of the employee’s employment in those operations shall be jointly and severally liable for the payment of compensation and of medical, surgical, legal and hospital expense which that may be awarded to the employee or his or her estate or dependents as the result of
				  disability or death resulting from or aggravated by the exposure.(2) In making its determination in the supplemental proceeding for the purpose of determining an apportionment of liability or of a right of contribution of percentage liabilities of the various employers engaged in underground metal mining operations the appeals board shall consider as a rebuttal presumption that employment in underground work in any mine for a continuous period of more than three calendar months will result in a silicotic exposure for the employee so employed during the period of employment if the underground metal mine was driven or sunk in rock having a composition which that will result in dissemination of silica or silicotic dust particles when drilled, blasted, or
				  transported.(g) Any employer shall be entitled to rebut the presumption by showing to the satisfaction of the appeals board, or the workers’ compensation judge, that the mining methods used by the employer in the employee’s place of employment did not result during his or her employment in the creation of silica dust in sufficient amount or concentration to constitute a silicotic hazard. Dust counts, competently made, at intervals and in locations as meet the requirements of the Division of Occupational Safety and Health for safe working conditions may be received as evidence of the amount and concentration of silica dust in the workings where the counts have been made at the time when they were made. The appeals board may from time to time, as its experience may indicate proper, promulgate orders as to the frequency with which dust counts shall be taken in different types of workings in order to justify their acceptance as evidence of the
				  existence or nonexistence of a silicotic hazard in the property where they have been taken.(h) The amendments to this section adopted at the 1959 1959-60 Regular Session of the Legislature shall operate retroactively, and shall apply retrospectively to any cases pending before the appeals board or courts. From and after the date this section becomes effective no payment shall be made out of the fund used for payment of the additional compensation provided for in Section 4751, or out of any other state funds, in satisfaction of any liability heretofore incurred or hereafter incurred, except awards which
				  that have become final without regard to the continuing jurisdiction of the appeals board on that effective date, and the state and its funds shall be without liability therefor. This subdivision shall not in any way effect a reduction in any benefit conferred or which that may be conferred upon any injured employee or his or her dependents.(i) The amendments to this section adopted at the 1977 1977-78 Regular Session of the Legislature
				  shall apply to any claims for benefits under this division which are filed or asserted on or after January 1, 1978, unless otherwise specified in this section.SEC. 26. Section 5501.5 of the Labor Code is amended to read:5501.5. (a) The application for adjudication of claim shall be filed in any of the following locations:(1) In the county where the injured employee or dependent of a deceased employee resides on the date of filing.(2) In the county where the injury allegedly occurred, or, in cumulative trauma and industrial disease claims, where the last alleged injurious exposure occurred.(3) In the county where the employee’s attorney maintains his or her principal place of business, if the employee is represented by an attorney.(b) If the county
				  selected for filing has more than one office of the appeals board, the application shall be filed at any location of the appeals board within that county that meets the criteria specified in subdivision (a). The written consent of the employee, or dependent of a deceased employee, to the selected venue site shall be filed with the application.(c) If the venue site where the application is to be filed is the county where the employee’s attorney maintains his or her principal place of business, the attorney for the employee shall indicate that venue site when forwarding the information request form required by Section 5401.5. The employer shall have 30 days from receipt of the information request form
				  conforming application to object
				  file and serve an objection to the selected venue site. Where there is an employer objection to a venue site under paragraph (3) of subdivision (a), then the application shall be filed pursuant to either paragraph (1) or (2) of subdivision (a). For purposes of this subdivision, a conforming application is one that includes the date it was filed with the appeals board and a case number.(d) If there is no appeals board office in the county where venue is permitted under subdivision (a), the application shall be filed at the appeals board office nearest the residence on the date of filing of the injured employee or dependent of a deceased employee, or the nearest place where the injury allegedly occurred, or, in cumulative trauma and industrial disease claims, where the last injurious exposure
				  occurred, or nearest the location where the attorney of the employee maintains his or her principal place of business, unless the employer objects under subdivision (c).SEC. 27. Section 5502 of the Labor Code is amended to read:5502. (a) Except as provided in subdivisions (b) and (d), the hearing shall be held not less than 10 days, and not more than 60 days, after the date a declaration of readiness to proceed, on a form prescribed by the court administrator, is filed. If a claim form has been filed for an injury occurring on or after January 1, 1990, and before January 1, 1994, an application for adjudication shall accompany the declaration of readiness to proceed.(b) The court administrator shall establish a priority calendar for issues requiring an expedited hearing and decision. A hearing shall be held and a determination as to the rights of the parties shall be made and filed within 30 days after the declaration of readiness to proceed is filed if
				  the issues in dispute are any of the following:(1) The employee’s entitlement to medical treatment pursuant to Section 4600.(2) The employee’s entitlement to, or the amount of, temporary disability indemnity payments.(3) The employee’s entitlement to vocational rehabilitation services, or the termination of an employer’s liability to provide these services to an employee.(4) The employee’s entitlement to compensation from one or more responsible employers when two or more employers dispute liability as among themselves.(5) Any other issues requiring an expedited hearing and determination as prescribed in rules and regulations of the administrative director
				  or court administrator.(c) The court administrator shall establish a priority conference calendar for cases in which the employee is represented by an attorney and
				  the issues in dispute are employment or injury arising out of employment or in the course of employment. The conference shall be conducted by a workers’ compensation administrative law judge within 30 days after the declaration of readiness to proceed. If the dispute cannot be resolved at the conference, a trial shall be set as expeditiously as possible, unless good cause is shown why discovery is not complete, in which case status conferences shall be held at regular intervals. The case shall be set for trial when discovery is complete, or when the workers’ compensation administrative law judge determines that the parties have had sufficient time in which to complete reasonable discovery. A determination as to the rights of the parties shall be made and filed within 30 days after the trial.(d) The court administrator shall report quarterly to the Governor and to the Legislature concerning the frequency and types of issues which
				  that
				  are not heard and decided within the period prescribed in this section and the reasons therefor.(e) (1) In all cases, a mandatory settlement conference shall be conducted not less than 10 days, and not more than 30 days, after the filing of a declaration of readiness to proceed. If the dispute is not resolved, the regular hearing shall be held within 75 days after the declaration of readiness to proceed is filed.(2) The settlement conference shall be conducted by a workers’ compensation administrative law judge or by a referee who is eligible to be a workers’ compensation administrative law judge or judge, a pro tempore workers’ compensation judge, or a person
				  eligible to be an arbitrator under
				  pursuant to Section 5270.5. At the mandatory settlement conference, the referee or workers’ compensation administrative law judge or other authorized officiant shall have the authority to resolve the dispute, including the authority to approve a compromise and release or issue a stipulated finding and award, and if the dispute cannot be resolved, to frame the issues and stipulations for trial. The appeals board shall adopt any regulations needed to implement this subdivision. The presiding workers’ compensation administrative law judge shall supervise settlement conference referees
				  workers’ compensation judges in the performance of their judicial functions under this subdivision.(3) If the claim is not resolved at the mandatory settlement conference, the parties shall file a pretrial conference statement noting the specific issues in dispute, each party’s proposed permanent disability rating, and listing the exhibits, and disclosing witnesses. Discovery shall close on the date of the mandatory settlement conference. Evidence not disclosed or obtained thereafter shall not be admissible unless the proponent of the evidence can demonstrate that it was not available or could not have been discovered by the exercise of due diligence prior to the settlement conference.(f) In cases involving the Director of the Department of Industrial Relations in his or her capacity as administrator of the Uninsured Employers Fund, this
				  section shall not apply unless proof of service, as specified in paragraph (1) of subdivision (d) of Section 3716 has been filed with the appeals board and provided to the Director of Industrial Relations, valid jurisdiction has been established over the employer, and the fund has been joined.(g) Except as provided in subdivision (a) and in Section 4065, the provisions of this section shall apply irrespective of the date of injury.SEC. 28. Section 5505 of the Labor Code is amended to read:5505. If any defendant desires to disclaim any interest in the subject matter of the claim in controversy, or considers that the application is in any respect inaccurate or incomplete, or desires to bring any fact, paper, or document to the attention of the appeals board as a defense to the claim or otherwise, he or she may, within 10 days after the service of the application upon him or her, file with or mail to the appeals board his or her answer in such form as the appeals board may prescribe,
				  setting forth the particulars in which the application is inaccurate or incomplete, and the facts upon which he or she intends to rely. A copy of the answer shall be forthwith served upon all adverse parties. Evidence upon matters not pleaded by answer shall be allowed only upon the terms and conditions imposed by the appeals board or referee
				  workers’ compensation judge holding the hearing.SEC. 29. Section 5700 of the Labor Code is amended to read:5700. The hearing on the application may be adjourned from time to time and from place to place in the discretion of the appeals board or the workers’ compensation judge holding the hearing.

In addition, a workers’ compensation referee judge or the appeals board, in its sole discretion, may
				  order additional sanctions not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) to be transmitted to the General Fund.(b) The determination of sanctions shall be made after written application by the party seeking sanctions or upon the appeal board’s own motion.(c) This section shall apply to all applications for adjudication that are filed on or after January 1, 1994.
