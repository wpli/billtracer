											  Continuing care retirement communities: contracts.(1) Under existing law, the State Department of Social Services is responsible for regulating activities relating to continuing care contracts that govern care provided to an elderly resident in a continuing care retirement community for the duration of the resident’s life or a term in excess of one year.This bill would transfer that responsibility, except with respect to oversight and regulation of programs and services provided directly to residents of the communities, to the Department of Insurance and would make related conforming changes.The bill would require, by not later than January 1, 2011, the Insurance Commissioner, the State Public Health Officer, and the Director of Social Services to jointly develop and adopt regulations regarding
		standards, staff training, policies, and procedures to ensure maximum coordination and consistency of implementation of the transfer required by the bill.(2) Existing law establishes the Continuing Care Provider Fee Fund, which is continuously appropriated to the State Department of Social Services for purposes of administering the continuing care retirement community requirements of existing law.This bill would, for purposes of administering the above provisions, create 2 accounts within the fund, the Insurance Account, which would be continuously appropriated to the Department of Insurance, and the State Department of Social Services Account, which would be continuously appropriated to the State Department of Social Services. Ninety-five percent of fees collected pursuant to the above-described provisions would be deposited into the Insurance Account and 5% into the State Department of Social
		Services Account.(3) Existing law requires insurers to comply with various requirements.This bill would require the Insurance Commissioner to apply certain of those requirements to continuing care retirement communities and contracts, including requirements related to the disclosure of material transactions and requirements related to provider holding company systems, as defined.The bill would additionally revise and recast other provisions applicable to continuing care retirement communities and contracts, including, among other things, requirements relating to application contents, increases in monthly care fees, dividends and distributions, reserve requirements, disclosure of beneficial ownership of a provider, and personal interests of officers of a provider.The bill would enact other related provisions.Digest Key

                                NO  Bill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. The Legislature hereby finds and declares the following:(a) California is home to nearly four million people over 65 years of age; the largest older adult population in the nation. This number is expected to more than double over the next several decades as the baby boomers begin reaching this milestone.(b) Continuing care retirement communities are an alternative for the long-term residential, social, and health care needs of California’s elderly residents and seek to provide a continuum of care, minimize transfer trauma, and allow services to be provided in an appropriately licensed setting.(c) Because
		  elderly residents often both expend a significant portion of their savings in order to purchase care in a continuing care retirement community and expect to receive care at their continuing care retirement community for the rest of their lives, tragic consequences can result if a continuing care provider becomes insolvent or unable to provide responsible care.(d) The Legislature has recognized the importance of continuing care provider solvency and the need for disclosure concerning the terms of agreements made between prospective residents and the continuing care provider, and concerning the operations of the continuing care retirement community.(e) The Legislature defines continuing care contracts in terms of a promise of the future provision of services which are analogous to insurance products.(f) Continuing
		  care retirement communities have long-term obligations and may have a corporate or capital structure similar to insurance holding company systems, as defined in the Insurance Code.(g) Therefore, it is the intent of the Legislature to transfer general regulatory responsibility for continuing care retirement communities, except for oversight and regulation of programs and services provided directly to residents of the communities, from the Department of Social Services to the Department of Insurance.SEC. 2. Section 1569.651 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:1569.651. (a) A licensee of a residential care facility for the elderly shall not require any form of preadmission fee or deposit from a recipient under the State Supplementary Program for the Aged, Blind and Disabled (Article 5 (commencing with Section 12200) of Chapter 3 of Part 3 of Division 9 of the Welfare and Institutions Code) who applies for admission to the facility.(b) If a licensee charges a preadmission fee, the licensee shall provide the applicant or his or her representative with a written general statement describing all costs associated with the preadmission fee charges and stating that the preadmission fee is refundable. The statement shall describe the conditions for the refund as specified in subdivision (g). A licensee shall only charge a single preadmission fee as defined in
				  subdivision (e) per resident admission.(c) A licensee of a residential care facility for the elderly shall not require, request, or accept any funds from a resident or a resident’s representative that constitutes a deposit against any possible damages by the resident.(d) Any fee charged by a licensee of a residential care facility for the elderly, whether prior to or after admission, shall be clearly specified in the admission agreement.(e) For the purposes of this section, “preadmission fee” means an application fee, processing fee, admission fee, entrance fee, community fee, or other fee, however designated, that is requested or accepted by a licensee of a residential care facility for the elderly prior to admission.(f) This section shall not apply to licensees of residential care facilities for the elderly that have obtained a certificate of authority to offer continuing care contracts, as
				  defined in paragraph (8) (9) of subdivision (c) of Section 1771.(g) If the applicant decides not to enter the facility prior to the facility’s completion of a preadmission appraisal or if the facility fails to provide full written disclosure of the preadmission fee charges and refund conditions, the applicant or the applicant’s representative shall be entitled to a refund of 100 percent of the preadmission fee.(h) Unless subdivision (g) applies, preadmission fees in excess of five hundred dollars ($500) shall be refunded according to the following:(1) If the applicant does not enter the facility after a preadmission appraisal is conducted, the applicant or the applicant’s representative shall be entitled to a refund of at least 80
				  percent of the preadmission fee amount in excess of five hundred dollars ($500).(2) If the resident leaves the facility for any reason during the first month of residency, the resident shall be entitled to a refund of at least 80 percent of the preadmission fee amount in excess of five hundred dollars ($500).(3) If the resident leaves the facility for any reason during the second month of residency, the resident shall be entitled to a refund of at least 60 percent of the preadmission fee amount in excess of five hundred dollars ($500).(4) If the resident leaves the facility for any reason during the third month of residency, the resident shall be entitled to a refund of at least 40 percent of the preadmission fee amount in excess of five hundred dollars ($500).(5) The facility may, but is not required to, make a refund of the preadmission fee for residents living in the facility for four or
				  more months.(i) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (g), if a resident is evicted by a facility pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 1569.682, the resident or the resident’s legal representative shall be entitled to a refund of preadmission fees in excess of five hundred dollars ($500) in accordance with all of the following:(A) A 100-percent refund if preadmission fees were paid within six months of notice of eviction.(B) A 75-percent refund if preadmission fees were paid more than six months but not more than 12 months before notice of eviction.(C) A 50-percent refund if preadmission fees were paid more than 12 months but not more than 18 months before notice of eviction.(D) A 25-percent refund if preadmission fees were paid more than 18 months but less than 25 months before notice of eviction.(2) No preadmission

				  plan.(B) A list of facilities, within a 60-mile radius of the resident’s current facility, that meet the resident’s present needs.(2) Provide each resident or the resident’s responsible person with a written notice no later than 60 days before the intended eviction. The notice shall include all of the following:(A) The reason for the eviction, with specific facts to permit a determination of the date, place, witnesses, and circumstances concerning the reasons.(B) A copy of the resident’s current service plan.(C) The relocation evaluation.(D) A list of referral agencies.(E) The right of the resident or resident’s legal representative to contact the department to investigate the reasons given for the eviction pursuant to Section 1569.35.(3) Discuss the relocation evaluation with the

In lieu of the refund, the resident may request that the licensee provide a credit toward the resident’s monthly fee obligation in an amount equal to the preadmission fee refund due.(7) If the resident gives notice five days before leaving the facility, the licensee shall refund to the resident or his or her legal representative a proportional per diem amount of any prepaid monthly fees at the time the resident leaves the facility and the unit is vacated. Otherwise the licensee shall pay the refund within seven days from the date that the
				  resident leaves the facility and the unit is vacated.(8) Within 10 days of all residents having left the facility, the licensee, based on information provided by the resident or resident’s legal representative, shall submit a final list of names and new locations of all residents to the department and the local ombudsperson program.(b) If seven or more residents of a residential care facility for the elderly will be transferred as a result of the forfeiture of a license or change in the use of the facility pursuant to subdivision (a), the licensee shall submit a proposed closure plan to the department for approval. The department shall approve or disapprove the closure plan, and monitor its implementation, in accordance with the following requirements:(1) Upon submission of the closure plan, the licensee shall be prohibited from accepting new residents and entering into new admission agreements for new residents.(2) The closure plan shall meet the requirements described in subdivision (a), and describe the staff available to assist in the transfers.

				  that may have placement or advocacy responsibility for the residents, and shall work with those agencies to locate alternative placement sites, contact relatives or other persons responsible for the care of these residents, provide onsite evaluation of the residents, and assist in the transfer of residents.(2) The participation of the department and local agencies in the relocation of residents from a residential care facility for the elderly shall not relieve the licensee of any responsibility under this section.

If the licensee fails to provide the relocation services required in subdivisions (a) and (b), then the department may request that the Attorney General’s office, the city attorney’s office, or the local district attorney’s office seek injunctive relief and damages in the same manner as
				  provided for in Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 17200) of Part 2 of Division 7 of the Business and Professions Code.(d) A licensee who fails to comply with requirements of this section shall be liable for the imposition of civil penalties in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100) per violation per day for each day that the licensee is in violation of this section, until such time that the violation has been corrected. The civil penalties shall be issued immediately following the written notice of violation. However, if the violation does not present an immediate or substantial threat to the health or safety of residents and the licensee corrects the violation within three days after receiving the notice of violation, the licensee shall not be liable for payment of any civil penalties pursuant to this subdivision related to the corrected violation.(e) A resident of a residential care facility for the elderly covered under this section, may bring a
				  civil action against any person, firm, partnership, or corporation who owns, operates, establishes, manages, conducts, or maintains a residential care facility for the elderly who violates the rights of a resident, as set forth in this section. Any person, firm, partnership, or corporation who owns, operates, establishes, manages, conducts, or maintains a residential care facility for the elderly who violates this section shall be responsible for the acts of the facility’s employees and shall be liable for costs and attorney fees. Any such residential care facility for the elderly may also be enjoined from permitting the violation to continue. The remedies specified in this section shall be in addition to any other remedy provided by law.(f) This section does not apply to a licensee that has obtained a certificate of authority to offer continuing care contracts, as defined in paragraph (8)
				  (9) of subdivision (c) of Section 1771.SEC. 4. Section 1569.80 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:1569.80. (a) A resident of a residential care facility for the elderly, or the resident’s representative, or both, shall have the right to participate in decisionmaking regarding the care and services to be provided to the resident.

The facility shall ensure that participants in the meeting prepare a written record of the care the resident will receive in the facility, and the resident’s preferences regarding the services provided at the
				  facility.(b)  Once prepared, the written record described in subdivision (a) shall be used by the facility, and, if applicable pursuant to Section 1569.725, the home health agency, to determine the care and services provided to the resident. If the resident has a regular physician, the written record shall be sent by the facility to that physician.(c)  The written record described in subdivision (a) shall be reviewed, and, if necessary, revised, at least once every 12 months, or upon a significant change in the resident’s condition, as defined by regulations, whichever occurs first.

				  not preclude a residential care facility for the elderly or home health agency from satisfying other state or federal obligations at a meeting required by subdivision (a) or (c).(e)  If the residential care facility for the elderly is a continuing care retirement community, as defined in paragraph (10) (12) of subdivision (c) of Section 1771, this section shall apply only to residents who require care and supervision, as defined in subdivision (b) of Section 1569.2.SEC. 2.SEC. 5. Section 1770 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:1770. The Legislature finds, declares, and intends all of the following:(a) Continuing care retirement communities are an alternative for the long-term residential, social, and health care needs of California’s elderly residents and seek to provide a continuum of care, minimize transfer trauma, and allow services to be provided in an appropriately licensed setting.(b) Because elderly residents often both expend a significant portion of their savings in order to purchase care in a continuing care retirement community and expect to receive care at their continuing care retirement community for the rest of their lives, tragic consequences can result if a continuing care provider becomes
				  insolvent or unable to provide responsible care.(c) There is a need for disclosure concerning the terms of agreements made between prospective residents and the continuing care provider, and concerning the operations of the continuing care retirement community.(d) Providers of continuing care should be required to obtain a certificate of authority to enter into continuing care contracts and should be monitored and regulated by the Department of Insurance.(e) This chapter applies equally to for-profit and nonprofit provider entities.(f) This chapter states the minimum requirements to be imposed upon any entity offering or providing continuing care.(g) Because the authority to enter
				  into continuing care contracts granted by the Department of Insurance is neither a guarantee of performance by the providers nor an endorsement of any continuing care contract provisions, prospective residents must carefully consider the risks, benefits, and costs before signing a continuing care contract and should be encouraged to seek financial and legal advice before doing so.SEC. 3.SEC. 6. Section 1770.5 is added to the Health and Safety Code, to read:1770.5. (a) The Department of Insurance shall succeed to and be vested with all the duties, powers, purposes, functions, responsibilities, and jurisdiction of the State Department of Social Services described in this chapter, except for oversight and regulation of programs and services provided directly to residents of the communities.

The substitution shall not in any way
				  affect the rights of the parties to the action. This substitution shall not be construed to affect the continuing responsibility of the State Department of Social Services to provide oversight and regulation of programs and services provided directly to residents of the communities.(d) All books, documents, records, and property of the State Department of Social Services pertaining to functions transferred to the Department of Insurance pursuant to this section shall be transferred to the Department of Insurance.(e) All unexpended balances of appropriations and other funds available for use in connection with any function or the administration of any law transferred to the Department of Insurance pursuant to this section shall be transferred to the Department of Insurance for use for the purpose for which the appropriation was originally made or the funds were originally
				  available. If there is any doubt as to where those balances and funds are transferred, the Department of Finance shall determine where the balances and funds are transferred.(f) No contract, lease, license, or any other agreement to which the State Department of Social Services is a party pursuant to this chapter shall be void or voidable by reason of this section, but shall continue in full force and effect, with the Department of Insurance assuming all of the rights, obligations, and duties of the State Department of Social Services under this chapter. That assumption by the Department of Insurance shall not in any way affect the rights of the parties to the contract, lease, license, or agreement.(g) Every officer and employee of the State Department of Social Services who is performing a function transferred to the Department of Insurance pursuant to this section and who is
				  serving in the state civil service, other than as a temporary employee, shall be transferred to the Department of Insurance pursuant to the provisions of Section 19050.9 of the Government Code.

				  refund liability shall be the sum of the products obtained pursuant to paragraph (10), multiplied by the rate of refund for the seventh year of residency, specified by current continuing care contracts, multiplied by the percentage of current continuing care contracts which specify this rate of refund. The projected refund liability amount shall be calculated for each rate, if existing continuing care contracts specify several rates.(12) The projected refund liability, or the aggregate of these liabilities, if several rates are obtained pursuant to paragraph (11), may be reduced by the value of the land used for the continuing care retirement community, inflated to the 40th year of operation, as determined pursuant to paragraph (4), if the provider agrees to a lien pursuant to Section 1793.15 to secure this commitment.(13) Calculate the present value of the projected refund liability at the current rate of interest for new 30-year treasury bonds. The
				  result is the required refund reserve.(e) Any entity which holds a certificate of authority, provisional certificate of authority, or permit to sell deposit subscriptions on or before September 23, 1986, shall be exempted from the refund reserve requirement established by this section, if the entity has an equity balance of five times the amount of the refund reserves calculated pursuant to subdivision (c).(1) The equity balance shall be verified by one or more of the following means:(A) The “stockholders’ equity,” or equivalent amount, as reflected on the most recent Form 10K (which may be on a consolidated basis or on a consolidated and combined basis) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.(B) The “total fund balance of net worth,” or equivalent amount, as reflected on Form 990 or Form 990-PF filed with the Internal Revenue Service.(C) The “total net
