Under existing law, there is also the Health Care Workforce Clearinghouse, established by OSHPD, that serves as the central source for collection, analysis, and distribution of information on the health care workforce employment and educational data trends for the state.This bill would require the Medical Board of California and the Board of Registered Nursing

		OSHPD, in consultation with the division and the clearinghouse department, to select a database and to also add some of the collected data collected in these applications and renewal forms to the database and to submit the data to the clearinghouse annually on or before January 1.
