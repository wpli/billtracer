						LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1152, Anderson.
											  Horse racing.Existing law, effective January 1, 2011, requires an outrider to be licensed by the California Horse Racing Board pursuant to certain provisions of law relating to stewards and racing officials.This bill would delete the requirement that outriders be licensed under those provisions.Existing law requires certain persons who participate in, or have anything to do with, the racing of horses to be licensed by the board pursuant to rules and regulations that the board may adopt, and upon the payment of a license fee fixed and determined by the board.This bill would require the licensure of outriders pursuant to those provisions. By requiring outriders to be licensed, the violation of which would be a crime pursuant to other provisions of existing law, this bill would create new crimes and would thereby impose a state-mandated local
		program.This bill would authorize the board to adopt regulations to require outrider license applicants to pass both a written and an oral examination and to authorize outriders to exercise certain duties and powers of the board as are delegated by the board.Existing law generally authorizes the board to allocate race dates, as specified.This bill would provide that notwithstanding any other provision of law, commencing July 1, 2010, if a racetrack located in the central zone is not available for use by a thoroughbred association that was licensed by the board to conduct a live race meet at that racetrack in 2009, the board shall be authorized to allocate racing dates to that association to be operated at a racetrack in the central zone or the southern zone for racing in 2010, or thereafter, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the board.Existing law authorizes advance deposit wagering to be conducted, with the approval of the board. Existing law requires amounts distributed under certain provisions of law relating to advance deposit wagering to be proportionally reduced by an amount equal to 0.00295 multiplied by the amount handled on advance deposit wagers originating in California for each racing meeting, not to exceed $2,000,000.This bill would exempt from that calculation amounts handled on advance deposit wagers originating in California for harness racing meetings.Existing law requires the amount deducted, as per the above calculation, to be distributed as specified, with 50% of the money to the board to establish and to administer jointly with a certain jockey organization, a defined contribution retirement plan for California-licensed jockeys who retired from racing on or after January 1, 2009, and who, as
		of the date of retirement, had ridden in a minimum of 1,250 parimutuel races conducted in California.This bill would delete that requirement relating to a minimum number of races ridden.This bill would require amounts distributed under certain provisions of law relating to advance deposit wagering to be proportionally reduced by an amount equal to 0.00295 multiplied by the amount handled on advance deposit wagers originating in California for each harness racing meeting, not to exceed $500,000. The bill would require the amount deducted to be distributed to a certain welfare fund established for the benefit of horsemen and backstretch personnel, as provided, and the amount remaining, if any, for the benefit of the horsemen, as specified. By imposing new requirements on licensees under the Horse Racing Law, the violation of which would be a crime, this bill would create new crimes and would thereby impose a state-mandated
		local program.The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.Digest Key

				  funds in this account, thereby authorizing the ADW provider holding the account to place wagers on the account owner’s behalf.(2) “ADW provider” means a licensee, betting system, or multijurisdictional wagering hub, located within California or outside this state, that is authorized to conduct advance deposit wagering pursuant to this section.(3) “Betting system” means a business conducted exclusively in this state that facilitates parimutuel wagering on races it simulcasts and other races it offers in its wagering menu.(4) “Breed of racing” means as follows:(A) With respect to associations and fairs licensed by the board to conduct thoroughbred, fair, or mixed breed race meetings, “breed of racing” shall mean thoroughbred.(B) With respect to associations licensed by the board to conduct quarter horse race meetings, “breed of racing” shall mean quarter horse.(C) With respect to associations and fairs licensed by the board to conduct standardbred race meetings, “breed of racing” shall mean standardbred.(5) “Contractual compensation” means the amount paid to an ADW provider from advance deposit wagers originating in this state.

				  amount wagered.(B) The host fee payments included within contractual compensation shall not exceed 3.5 percent of the amount wagered. Notwithstanding this provision, the host fee payment with respect to wagers on the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes, Belmont Stakes, and selected Breeders’ Cup Championship races may be negotiated by the ADW provider, the racing associations accepting wagers on those races pursuant to Section 19596.2, and the horsemen’s organization.(C) In order to ensure fair and consistent market access fee distributions to associations, fairs, horsemen, and breeders, for each breed of racing, the percentage of wagers paid as contractual compensation to an ADW provider pursuant to the terms of a hub agreement with a racing association or fair when that racing association or fair is conducting live racing shall be the same as the percentage of wagers paid as
				  contractual compensation to that ADW provider when that racing association or fair is not conducting live racing.(6) “Horsemen’s organization” means, with respect to a particular racing meeting, the organization recognized by the board as responsible for negotiating purse agreements on behalf of horsemen participating in that racing meeting.(7) “Hub agreement” means a written agreement providing for contractual compensation paid with respect to advance deposit wagers placed by California residents on a particular breed of racing conducted outside of California. In the event a hub agreement exceeds a term of two years, then an ADW provider, one or more racing associations or fairs that together conduct no fewer than five weeks of live racing for the breed covered by the hub agreement, and the horsemen’s organization responsible for negotiating purse agreements for the breed
				  covered by the hub agreement shall be signatories to the hub agreement. A hub agreement is required for an ADW provider to receive contractual compensation for races conducted outside of California.(8) “Hub agreement arbitration” means an arbitration proceeding pursuant to which the disputed provisions of the hub agreement pertaining to the hub or host fees from wagers on races conducted outside of California provided pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (b) are determined in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph. If a hub agreement arbitration is requested, all of the following shall apply:(A) The ADW provider shall be permitted to accept advance deposit wagers from California residents.(B) The contractual compensation received by the ADW provider shall be the contractual compensation specified in
				  the hub agreement that is the subject of the hub agreement arbitration.(C) The difference between the contractual compensation specified in subparagraph (B) and the contractual compensation determined to be payable at the conclusion of the hub agreement arbitration shall be calculated and paid within 15 days following the arbitrator’s decision and order. The hub agreement arbitration shall be held as promptly as possible, but in no event more than 60 days following the demand for that arbitration. The arbitrator shall issue a decision no later than 15 days following the conclusion of the arbitration. A single arbitrator jointly selected by the ADW provider and the party requesting a hub agreement arbitration shall conduct the hub agreement arbitration. However, if the parties cannot agree on the arbitrator within seven days of issuance of the written demand for arbitration, then the arbitrator shall be selected pursuant to the Streamlined
				  Arbitration Rules and Procedures of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, or pursuant to the applicable rules of its successor organization. In making the hub agreement arbitration determination, the arbitrator shall be required to choose between the contractual compensation of the hub agreement agreed to by the ADW provider or whatever different terms for the hub agreement were proposed by the party requesting the hub agreement arbitration. The arbitrator shall not be permitted to impose new, different, or compromised terms to the hub agreement. The arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding on the parties. If an arbitration is requested, either party may bring an action in state court to compel a party to go into arbitration or to enforce the decision of the arbitrator. The cost of the hub agreement arbitration, including the cost of the arbitrator, shall be borne in equal shares by the parties to the hub agreement and the party or parties requesting a hub agreement arbitration. The hub
				  agreement arbitration shall be administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services pursuant to its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or its successor organization.(9) “Incentive awards” means those payments provided for in Sections 19617.2, 19617.7, 19617.8, 19617.9, and 19619. The amount determined to be payable for incentive awards under this section shall be payable to the applicable official registering agency and thereafter distributed as provided in this chapter.(10) “Licensee” means any racing association or fair licensed to conduct a live racing meet in this state, or affiliation thereof, authorized under this section.(11) “Market access fee” means the amount of advance deposit wagering handle remaining after the payment of winning wagers, and after the payment of contractual
				  compensation, if any, to an ADW provider. Market access fees shall be distributed in accordance with subdivision (f).(12) “Multijurisdictional wagering hub” means a business conducted in more than one jurisdiction that facilitates parimutuel wagering on races it simulcasts and other races it offers in its wagering menu.(13) “Racing fair” means a fair authorized by the board to conduct live racing.(14) “Zone” means the zone of the state, as defined in Section 19530.5, except as modified by the provisions of subdivision (f) of Section 19601. For these purposes, the central and southern zones shall together be considered one zone.(b) Wagers shall be accepted according to the procedures set forth in this subdivision.(1) No ADW provider shall accept wagers or wagering instructions on races conducted in California from a resident of California unless all of the following conditions are met:(A) The ADW provider is licensed by the board.(B) A written agreement allowing those wagers exists with the racing association or fair conducting the races on which the wagers are made.(C) The agreement referenced in subparagraph (B) shall have been approved in writing by the horsemen’s organization responsible for negotiating purse agreements for the breed on which the wagers are made in accordance with the Interstate Horseracing Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 3001, et seq.), regardless of the location of the ADW provider, whether in California or otherwise, including, without limitation,
				  any and all requirements contained therein with respect to written consents and required written agreements of horsemen’s groups to the terms and conditions of the acceptance of those wagers and any arrangements as to the exclusivity between the host racing association or fair and the ADW provider. For purposes of this subdivision, the substantive provisions of the Interstate Horseracing Act shall be taken into account without regard to whether, by its own terms, that act is applicable to advance deposit wagering on races conducted in California accepted from residents of California.(2) No ADW provider shall accept wagers or wagering instructions on races conducted outside of California from a resident of California unless all of the following conditions are met:(A) The ADW provider is licensed by the board.(B) There is a hub agreement between the ADW provider and one or both of (i) one or more racing associations or fairs that together conduct no fewer than five weeks of live racing on the breed on which wagering is conducted during the calendar year during which the wager is placed, and (ii) the horsemen’s organization responsible for negotiating purse agreements for the breed on which wagering is conducted.(C) If the parties referenced in clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (B) are both signatories to the hub agreement, then no party shall have the right to request a hub agreement arbitration.(D) If only the party or parties referenced in clause (i) of subparagraph (B) is a signatory to the hub agreement, then the signatories to the hub agreement shall, within five days of execution of the hub agreement, provide a copy of the hub agreement to the horsemen’s
				  organization responsible for negotiating purse agreements for the breed on which wagering is conducted for each race conducted outside of California on which California residents may place advance deposit wagers. Prior to receipt of the hub agreement, the horsemen’s organization shall sign a nondisclosure agreement with the ADW provider agreeing to hold confidential all terms of the hub agreement. If the horsemen’s organization wants to request a hub agreement arbitration, it shall send written notice of its election to the signatories to the hub agreement within 10 days after receipt of the copy of the hub agreement, and shall provide its alternate proposal to the hub and host fees specified in the hub agreement with that written notice. If the horsemen’s organization does not provide that written notice within the 10-day period, then no party shall have the right to request a hub agreement arbitration. If the horsemen’s organization does provide that written notice within the 10-day period, then the ADW
				  provider shall have 10 days to elect in writing to do one of the following:(i) Abandon the hub agreement.(ii) Accept the alternate proposal submitted by the horsemen’s organization.(iii) Proceed with a hub agreement arbitration.(E) If only the party referenced in clause (ii) of subparagraph (B) is a signatory to the hub agreement, then the signatories to the hub agreement shall, within five days of execution of the hub agreement, provide written notice of the host and hub fees applicable pursuant to the hub agreement for each race conducted outside of California on which California residents may place advance deposit wagers, which notice shall be provided to all racing associations and fairs conducting live racing of the same breed covered by the
				  hub agreement. If any racing association or fair wants to request a hub agreement arbitration, it shall send written notice of its election to the signatories to the hub agreement within 10 days after receipt of the notice of host and hub fees. It shall also provide its alternate proposal to the hub and host fees specified in the hub agreement with the notice of its election. If more than one racing association or fair provides notice of their request for hub agreement arbitration, those racing associations or fairs, or both, shall have a period of five days to jointly agree upon which of their alternate proposals shall be the official proposal for purposes of the hub agreement arbitration. If one or more racing associations or fairs that together conduct no fewer than five weeks of live racing on the breed on which wagering is conducted during the calendar year during which the wager is placed does not provide written notice of their election to arbitrate within the 10-day period, then no party shall have
				  the right to request a hub agreement arbitration. If a valid hub agreement arbitration request is made, then the ADW provider shall have 10 days to elect in writing to do one of the following:(i) Abandon the hub agreement.(ii) Accept the alternate proposal submitted by the racing associations or fairs.(iii) Proceed with a hub agreement arbitration.The results of any hub agreement arbitration elected pursuant to this subdivision shall be binding on all other associations and fairs conducting live racing on that breed.(F) The acceptance thereof is in compliance with the provisions of the Interstate Horseracing Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 3001, et seq.), regardless of the location of the ADW provider, whether in
				  California or otherwise, including, without limitation, any and all requirements contained therein with respect to written consents and required written agreements of horsemen’s groups to the terms and conditions of the acceptance of such wagers and any arrangements as to the exclusivity between the host racing association or fair and the ADW provider.(c) An advance deposit wager may be made only by the ADW provider holding the account pursuant to wagering instructions issued by the owner of the funds communicated by telephone call or through other electronic media. The ADW provider shall ensure the identification of the account’s owner by using methods and technologies approved by the board. Any ADW provider that accepts wagering instructions concerning races conducted in California, or accepts wagering instructions originating in California, shall provide a full accounting and verification of the source of the wagers thereby made, including
				  the postal ZIP Code and breed of the source of the wagers, in the form of a daily download of parimutuel data to a database designated by the board. The daily download shall be delivered in a timely basis using file formats specified by the database designated by the board, and shall include any and all data necessary to calculate and distribute moneys according to the rules and regulations governing California parimutuel wagering. Any and all reasonable costs associated with the creation, provision, and transfer of this data shall be borne by the ADW provider.(d) (1) (A) The board shall develop and adopt rules to license and regulate all phases of operation of advance deposit wagering for ADW providers operating in California.(B) The board shall not approve an application for an original or renewal license as an ADW provider unless
				  the entity, if requested in writing by a bona fide labor organization no later than 90 days prior to licensing, has entered into a contractual agreement with that labor organization that provides all of the following:(i) The labor organization has historically represented employees who accept or process any form of wagering at the nearest horse racing meeting located in California.(ii) The agreement establishes the method by which the ADW provider will agree to recognize and bargain in good faith with a labor organization which has demonstrated majority status by submitting authorization cards signed by those employees who accept or process any form of wagering for which a California ADW license is required.(iii) The agreement requires the ADW provider to maintain its neutrality concerning the choice of those
				  employees who accept or process any form of wagering for which a California ADW license is required whether or not to authorize the labor organization to represent them with regard to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment.(iv) The agreement applies to those classifications of employees who accept or process wagers for which a California ADW license is required whether the facility is located within or outside of California.(C) (i) The agreement required by subparagraph (B) shall not be conditioned by either party upon the other party agreeing to matters outside the requirements of subparagraph (B).(ii) The requirement in subparagraph (B) shall not apply to an ADW provider which has entered into a collective bargaining agreement with a bona fide labor organization that is
				  the exclusive bargaining representative of employees who accept or process parimutuel wagers on races for which an ADW license is required whether the facility is located within or outside of California.(D) Permanent state or county employees and nonprofit organizations that have historically performed certain services at county, state, or district fairs may continue to provide those services.(E) Parimutuel clerks employed by racing associations or fairs or employees of ADW providers who accept or process any form of wagers who are laid off due to lack of work shall have preferential hiring rights for new positions with their employer in occupations whose duties include accepting or processing any form of wagers, or the operation, repair, service, or maintenance of equipment that accepts or processes any form of wagering at a racetrack, satellite wagering facility, or ADW
				  provider licensed by the board. The preferential hiring rights established by this subdivision shall be conditioned upon the employee meeting the minimum qualification requirements of the new job.(2) The board shall develop and adopt rules and regulations requiring ADW providers to establish security access policies and safeguards, including, but not limited to, the following:(A) The ADW provider shall use board-approved methods to perform location and age verification confirmation with respect to persons establishing an advance deposit wagering account.(B) The ADW provider shall use personal identification numbers (PINs) or other technologies to assure that only the accountholder has access to the advance deposit wagering account.(C) The ADW
				  provider shall provide for withdrawals from the wagering account only by means of a check made payable to the accountholder and sent to the address of the accountholder or by means of an electronic transfer to an account held by the verified accountholder or the accountholder may withdraw funds from the wagering account at a facility approved by the board by presenting verifiable account identification information.(D) The ADW provider shall allow the board access to its premises to visit, investigate, audit, and place expert accountants and other persons it deems necessary for the purpose of ensuring that its rules and regulations concerning credit authorization, account access, and other security provisions are strictly complied with. To ensure that the amounts retained from the parimutuel handle are distributed under law, rules, or agreements, any ADW provider that accepts wagering instructions concerning races conducted in California or
				  accepts wagering instructions originating in California shall provide an independent “agreed-upon procedures” audit for each California racing meeting, within 60 days of the conclusion of the race meeting. The auditing firm to be used and the content and scope of the audit, including host fee obligations, shall be set forth in the applicable agreement. The ADW provider shall provide the board, horsemen’s organizations, and the host racing association with an annual parimutuel audit of the financial transactions of the ADW provider with respect to wagers authorized pursuant to this section, prepared in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and the requirements of the board. Any and all reasonable costs associated with those audits shall be borne by the ADW provider.(3) The board shall prohibit advance deposit wagering advertising that it determines to be deceptive to the public. The board shall also require, by regulation, that
				  every form of advertising contain a statement that minors are not allowed to open or have access to advance deposit wagering accounts.(e) In order for a licensee, betting system, or multijurisdictional wagering hub to be approved by the board as an ADW provider, it shall meet both of the following requirements:(1) All wagers thereby made shall be included in the appropriate parimutuel pool under a contractual agreement with the applicable host track.(2) The amounts deducted from advance deposit wagers shall be in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.(f) After the payment of contractual compensation, the amounts received as market access fees from advance deposit wagers, which shall not be considered for purposes of Section 19616.51, shall
				  be distributed as follows:(1) An amount equal to 0.0011 multiplied by the amount handled on advance deposit wagers originating in California for each racing meeting shall be distributed to the Center for Equine Health to establish the Kenneth L. Maddy Fund for the benefit of the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of California at Davis.(2) An amount equal to 0.0003 multiplied by the amount handled on advance deposit wagers originating in California for each racing meeting shall be distributed to the Department of Industrial Relations to cover costs associated with audits conducted pursuant to Section 19526 and for the purposes of reimbursing the State Mediation and Conciliation Service for costs incurred pursuant to this section. However, if that amount would exceed the costs of the Department of Industrial Relations, the amount distributed to the department shall
				  be reduced, and that reduction shall be forwarded to an organization designated by the racing association or fair described in subdivision (a) for the purpose of augmenting a compulsive gambling prevention program specifically addressing that problem.(3) An amount equal to 0.00165 multiplied by the amount handled on advance deposit wagers that originate in California for each racing meeting shall be distributed as follows:(A) One-half of the amount shall be distributed to supplement the trainer-administered pension plans for backstretch personnel established pursuant to Section 19613. Moneys distributed pursuant to this subparagraph shall supplement, and not supplant, moneys distributed to that fund pursuant to Section 19613 or any other provision of law.(B) One-half of the amount shall be distributed to the
				  welfare fund established for the benefit of horsemen and backstretch personnel pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 19641. Moneys distributed pursuant to this subparagraph shall supplement, and not supplant, moneys distributed to that fund pursuant to Section 19641 or any other provision of law.(4) With respect to wagers on each breed of racing that originate in California, an amount equal to 2 percent of the first two hundred fifty million dollars ($250,000,000) of handle from all advance deposit wagers originating from within California annually, an amount equal to 1.5 percent of the next two hundred fifty million dollars ($250,000,000) of handle from all advance deposit wagers originating from within California annually, an amount equal to 1 percent of the next two hundred fifty million dollars ($250,000,000) of handle from all advance deposit wagers originating from within California annually, and an amount equal to 0.50 percent of
				  handle from all advance deposit wagers originating from within California in excess of seven hundred fifty million dollars ($750,000,000) annually, shall be distributed as satellite wagering commissions. Satellite wagering facilities that were not operational in 2001, other than one each in the Cities of Inglewood and San Mateo, and two additional facilities each operated by the Alameda County Fair and the Los Angeles County Fair and their partners and other than existing facilities which are relocated, are not eligible for satellite wagering commission distributions under this section. The satellite wagering facility commissions calculated in accordance with this subdivision shall be distributed to each satellite wagering facility and racing association or fair in the zone in which the wager originated in the same relative proportions that the satellite wagering facility or the racing association or fair generated satellite commissions during the previous calendar year. If there is a reduction in the
				  satellite wagering commissions pursuant to this section, the benefits therefrom shall be distributed equitably as purses and commissions to all associations and racing fairs generating advance deposit wagers in proportion to the handle generated by those associations and racing fairs. If a satellite wagering facility is permanently closed other than for renovation or remodeling, or if a satellite wagering facility is unwilling or unable to accept all of the signals that are available to that facility, the commissions otherwise provided for in this subdivision that would be payable to that facility shall be proportionately reduced to take into account the time that satellite wagering is no longer conducted by that facility, or the payment of those commissions shall be eliminated entirely if the facility is permanently closed, and, in either case, the satellite wagering commissions not paid shall be proportionately redistributed to the other eligible satellite wagering facilities. For purposes of this section,
				  the purse funds distributed pursuant to Section 19605.72 shall be considered to be satellite wagering facility commissions attributable to thoroughbred races at the locations described in that section.(5) After the distribution of the amounts set forth in paragraphs (1) to (4), inclusive, the remaining market access fees from advance deposit wagers originating in California shall be as follows:(A) With respect to wagers on each breed of racing, the amount remaining shall be distributed to the racing association or fair that is conducting live racing on that breed during the calendar period in the zone in which the wager originated. That amount shall be allocated to that racing association or fair as commissions, to horsemen participating in that racing meeting in the form of purses, and as incentive awards, in the same relative proportion as they were generated or earned during
				  the prior calendar year at that racing association or fair on races conducted or imported by that racing association or fair after making all deductions required by applicable law. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the distributions with respect to each breed of racing set forth in this subparagraph may be altered upon the approval of the board, in accordance with an agreement signed by the respective associations, fairs, horsemen’s organizations, and breeders organizations receiving those distributions.(B) If the provisions of Section 19601.2 apply, then the amount distributed to the applicable racing associations or fairs shall first be divided between those racing associations or fairs in direct proportion to the total amount wagered in the applicable zone on the live races conducted by the respective association or fair. Notwithstanding this requirement, when the provisions of subdivision (b) of Section 19607.5 apply to the 2nd
				  District Agricultural Association in Stockton or the California Exposition and State Fair in Sacramento, then the total amount distributed to the applicable racing associations or fairs shall first be divided equally, with 50 percent distributed to applicable fairs and 50 percent distributed to applicable associations.(C) Notwithstanding any provisions of this section to the contrary, with respect to wagers on out-of-state and out-of-country thoroughbred races conducted after 6 p.m., Pacific time, 50 percent of the amount remaining shall be distributed as commissions to thoroughbred associations and racing fairs, as thoroughbred and fair purses, and as incentive awards in accordance with subparagraph (A), and the remaining 50 percent, together with the total amount remaining from advance deposit wagering originating from California out-of-state and out-of-country harness and quarter horse races conducted after 6 p.m., Pacific time, shall be
				  distributed as commissions on a pro rata basis to the applicable licensed quarter horse association and the applicable licensed harness association, based upon the amount handled in state, both on- and off-track, on each breed’s own live races in the previous year by that association, or its predecessor association. One-half of the amount thereby received by each association shall be retained by that association as a commission, and the other half of the money received shall be distributed as purses to the horsemen participating in its current or next scheduled licensed racing meeting.(D) Notwithstanding any provisions of this section to the contrary, with respect to wagers on out-of-state and out-of-country nonthoroughbred races conducted before 6 p.m., Pacific time, 50 percent of the amount remaining shall be distributed as commissions as provided in subparagraph (C) for licensed quarter horse and harness associations, and the remaining 50
