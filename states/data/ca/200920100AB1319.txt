						LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1319, Krekorian.
											  Talent services.Existing law regulates the licensing and operation of talent services within the entertainment industry. These provisions govern the making and canceling of contracts, fees to be charged for services, records to be maintained by talent services, bonding requirements, and remedies for violations of these provisions, a violation of which constitutes a crime.This bill would prohibit a person from engaging, as specified, in an advance-fee talent representation service, as defined. This bill would also impose additional disclosure and contract requirements for a talent service, as defined. The bill would make a willful violation of its provisions a misdemeanor and subject to a civil action.Because the bill would create new crimes, it would impose a state-mandated local program.The California Constitution requires the state
		to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.Digest Key

		  competition, fair dealing, and prosperity in the field of talent services by prohibiting or restricting false or misleading advertising and other unfair, dishonest, deceptive, destructive, unscrupulous, and fraudulent business practices by which the public has been injured in connection with talent services.Nothing in this act is intended to prohibit talent training services, talent counseling services, and talent listing services from conducting business provided they comply with the provisions and prohibitions set forth in this act. Nothing in this chapter is intended to prohibit legitimate contractual business relationships between artists and bona fide record companies or to excuse a person from complying with Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 1700).SEC. 2. Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 1701) of Part 6 of Division 2 of the Labor Code is repealed.SEC. 3. Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 1701) is added to Part 6 of Division 2 of the Labor Code, to read:
