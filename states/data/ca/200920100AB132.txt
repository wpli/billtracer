						Romero, Yee)January 20, 2009An act to add Article 6 (commencing with Section 32297) to Chapter 2.5 of Part 19 of Division 1 of Title 1 of the Education Code, relating to pupil safety.LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 132, Mendoza.
											  School safety: immigration investigations.Existing law recognizes that all pupils enrolled in the state public schools have the inalienable right to attend classes on school campuses that are safe, secure, and peaceful. Existing law establishes various safety programs and procedures to address issues relating to school safety.This bill would provide that it is the policy of the state that immigration agents should not interfere with the education of pupils in school. The bill would specify, however, that this policy not impede or restrict any lawful authority of immigration agents. The bill would, except as required by federal or state law, prohibit school officials and employees from collecting information or documents and from inquiring about the immigration status of pupils or their family members. The bill would, if an employee of a school is aware that a pupil’s parent or guardian is not available to care for the pupil, encourage the school to comply with
		certain procedures relating to procuring child care for the pupil. The bill also would encourage schools to provide counseling services for pupils affected by enforcement activities of immigration agents, as specified.Digest Key
