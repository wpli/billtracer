						LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1471, Eng.
											  Procurement: Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority.The County Transportation Commissions Act provides for the creation of county transportation commissions and authorities in 5 counties, including the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, with specified powers and duties relative to transportation planning, programming, and operations. Existing law specifies certain procurement procedures applicable to these agencies, with certain procedures applicable solely to the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Existing law generally provides that purchase by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority or another county transportation commission of all supplies, equipment, and materials, and the construction of all facilities and works, when the expenditure required exceeds $25,000, shall be by contract let to the lowest responsible bidder, with certain exceptions. Existing law requires the authority to obtain a minimum
		of 3 quotations when the expected expenditure exceeds $2,500 and is not more than $100,000.This bill would increase that threshold to $3,000. The bill would delete a duplicate provision relating to the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority in a provision of the Public Contract Code governing the contracting procedures of the Sacramento Regional Transit District. The bill would delete an unnecessary reference to the authority in a provision of the Public Contract Code governing the contracting procedures of 2 transit development boards in San Diego County.This bill would also authorize the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority to purchase supplies, equipment, and materials from a public auction sale using the procedures established for all other participants in the auction. The bill would authorize the authority to participate in a cooperative procurement agreement with other public
		agencies under specified conditions.Digest Key
