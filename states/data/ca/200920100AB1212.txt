						RuskinFebruary 27, 2009 An act to add Article 3 (commencing with Section 43300) to Chapter 2 of Part 5 of Division 26 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to vehicle emissions. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 1212, as introduced, Ruskin.
											  Air resources: clean vehicle incentive program.Existing law designates the State Air Resources Board as the state agency with the primary responsibility for the control of vehicular air pollution and as the state agency charged with monitoring and regulating sources of emissions of greenhouse gases that cause global warming in order to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Existing law establishes the Air Pollution Control Fund. Moneys in the fund are available, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to the state board to carry out its duties and functions.Existing law requires the state board, no later than January 1, 2005, to develop and adopt regulations that achieve the maximum feasible and cost-effective reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles. Existing law provides that if regulations adopted pursuant to these provisions do not remain in effect, the state board is required to implement alternative regulations to control mobile sources of
		greenhouse gas emissions to achieve equivalent or greater reductions.Under existing law, the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, the state board is also required to adopt a statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit equivalent to the statewide greenhouse gas emissions level in 1990 to be achieved by 2020.This bill would authorize the state board to adopt and implement a clean vehicle incentive, or feebate, program consisting of one-time rebates and one-time surcharges on the sale of new passenger motor vehicles. The bill would require the state board to establish the program only if the state board determines that it would be beneficial to achieving the greenhouse gas emission goals of the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006.The bill would require the state board to adopt and implement a clean vehicle incentive program to achieve equivalent or greater
		emission reductions of greenhouse gases from mobile sources if the state board determines that the above provisions of existing law requiring the state board to develop and adopt regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles by January 1, 2005, do not remain in effect or are substantially delayed. This bill would also require any revenues collected under the program to be deposited into the Air Pollution Control Fund and, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to only be expended by the state board to implement these provisions.Digest Key

                                NO  Bill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. Article 3 (commencing with Section 43300) is added to Chapter 2 of Part 5 of Division 26 of the Health and Safety Code, to read:
								Article
							 3. Clean Vehicle Incentive Program43300. The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:(a) According to the state board and the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission, the transportation sector is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in California.(b) Multiple independent economic studies indicate that undertaking action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will likely create long-term economic benefits to the state’s economy.(c) Market-based incentives can augment existing state vehicle emissions standards by encouraging automobile buyers to purchase cleaner vehicles and by encouraging manufacturers to offer more low-emitting vehicle
					 choices to California consumers.(d) One-time rebates for the purchase of new motor vehicles that emit low amounts of greenhouse gases are a reasonable and appropriate method to provide incentives for the purchase of these vehicles.(e) One-time surcharges on new motor vehicles sold in California that emit high amounts of greenhouse gases are a reasonable and appropriate method to provide disincentives to the purchase of these vehicles and to shift the environmental costs normally borne by the public to the purchasers of these vehicles.(f) The creation of a clean vehicle incentive, or feebate, program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles is a market-based mechanism that does not create any new regulatory standard under the law.(g) The state board, in adopting its Climate Change Scoping Plan, indicated that it plans to pursue a “feebate” program as a backstop to the state’s greenhouse gas vehicle emission regulations if those regulations cannot be implemented.43301. (a) The state board may adopt and implement a clean vehicle incentive, or feebate, program consisting of one-time rebates and one-time surcharges on the sale of new passenger motor vehicles, to mitigate against emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles. The state board shall establish this program only if it finds that the implementation of the program would be beneficial to achieving the greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals of the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (Division 25.5 (commencing with Section 38500)).(b) The state board, pursuant to Section 38590, shall adopt and implement a clean vehicle incentive program in order to achieve equivalent or greater emission reductions of greenhouse gases from mobile sources
					 if the state board determines that the regulations adopted pursuant to Section 43018.5 do not remain in effect or are substantially delayed.(c) Any program established pursuant to subdivision (a) or (b) shall, to the extent possible, be self-financing.(d) Revenues collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited into the Air Pollution Control Fund, established pursuant to Section 43015, and, upon appropriation by the Legislature, may only be expended by the state board to implement this article.(e) The state board shall implement this section in a manner that does not result in the levying of a tax within the meaning of Article XIII A of the California Constitution in that the nature of the fee has a fair and reasonable relationship to the environmental, public health, and societal burdens imposed by the
					 motor vehicles subjected to the fee, and there is a sufficient nexus between the fees imposed and the use of those fees to support the clean vehicle incentive program that helps to redress the impacts caused by higher-emitting vehicles as determined by the state board.
