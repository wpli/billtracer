Existing law also requires that a copy of this biennial report be submitted to the legislative bodies of the local jurisdictions comprising the G-TEDA for review.This bill would delete the requirement that this report be
		submitted to the legislative bodies of the local jurisdictions comprising the G-TEDA.Existing law establishes a low-income housing tax credit program, administered by the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee, which provides procedures and requirements for the allocation of state tax credit amounts among low-income housing projects based on federal law. Existing law, among other things, provides for the recapture for noncompliance, in a specified amount, of tax credits previously granted with respect to the costs of constructing or rehabilitating farmworker housing.This bill would, in the case of the credit applicable to farmworker housing, modify the recapture amount, as provided.

However, the department shall audit each G-TEDA at least once every five years from the date of designation or the operative date of this section, whichever is the latest. The matters to be examined in the course of an audit shall include an examination of the progress made by the G-TEDA toward meeting the goals, objectives, and commitments set forth in its original application and the department’s memorandum of understanding with the G-TEDA.(b) The department shall, for each audit, determine a result of superior, pass, or fail in accordance with subdivision (c). The results of each audit shall be based upon the success of the G-TEDA in making
				  substantial and sustained efforts since the later of its designation or last audit to meet the standards, criteria, and conditions contained in the application and the memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the department and the G-TEDA, as may be amended pursuant to the agreement of the G-TEDA and the department. In each audit, the department shall focus upon the G-TEDA’s use of the marketing plan, local incentives, financing programs, job development, and program management as described in the application and the MOU. The department shall also evaluate the vouchering plan, staffing levels, budget, and elements unique to each application.(c) For purposes of subdivision (b), an audit determination of superior, pass, or fail shall be made in accordance with the following:(1) A G-TEDA will be determined to be superior if each jurisdiction comprising the G-TEDA does all of the following:(A) Meets 100 percent of its goals,
				  objectives, and commitments as defined in its application, most recent audit, biennial report, and memorandum of understanding with the department, and as determined by the department in consultation with the G-TEDA. An equivalent or similar commitment may be substituted for an existing commitment of a G-TEDA if it is determined by the department that an original commitment was not realistically practical or is no longer relevant.(B) Demonstrates that it has reviewed and updated its goals, objectives, and commitments as defined in its original application, most recent audit, biennial report, and memorandum of understanding with the department.(C) Identifies to the department’s satisfaction that it has incorporated economic development commitments in addition to those commitments previously made in its application.(2) (A) A G-TEDA will be determined to be passing if each jurisdiction comprising the
				  area meets or exceeds 75 percent of its goals, objectives, or commitments as defined in its original application, most recent audit, biennial report, and memorandum of understanding with the department, and as determined by the department in consultation with the G-TEDA. An equivalent or similar commitment may be substituted for an existing commitment of a G-TEDA if it is determined by the department that an original commitment was not realistically practical or is no longer relevant.(B) Any G-TEDA that is determined to be passing may appeal in writing to the department for a determination of superior. Only one appeal may be filed pursuant to this subparagraph with respect to a determination by the department, and may be filed no later than 30 days after the G-TEDA’s receipt of the determination to which the appeal pertains. The department shall respond in writing to any appeal that is properly filed pursuant to this subparagraph within 60 days of the date of that filing.(3) (A) A G-TEDA will be determined to be failing if any jurisdiction comprising the G-TEDA fails to meet or exceed 75 percent of its goals, objectives, or commitments as defined in its original application, most recent audit, biennial report, and memorandum of understanding with the department, and as determined by the department in consultation with the G-TEDA. An equivalent or similar commitment may be substituted for an existing commitment of a G-TEDA if it is determined by the department that an original commitment was not realistically practical or is no longer relevant.(B) Any G-TEDA that is determined to be failing shall enter into a written agreement with the department that specifies those items that the G-TEDA is required to remedy or improve. Failure of the G-TEDA and the department to negotiate and enter into a written agreement as so described within 60 days of the last day upon which the department is required to

If, upon expiration of the agreement, the department determines that the G-TEDA has met or implemented at least 75 percent of the conditions set forth in the agreement, the department shall do either of the following:(i) Allow the G-TEDA an
				  additional year, or a longer period in the department’s discretion, to meet or implement those conditions in their entirety.(ii) Pursuant to written notice provided immediately to each jurisdiction that comprises the G-TEDA that the G-TEDA is to be dedesignated, dedesignate the G-TEDA effective on January 1 immediately following the date of the department’s written notification of dedesignation to those jurisdictions.Any business, located within any jurisdiction that comprises a G-TEDA that has been dedesignated, that has elected to avail itself of any state tax incentive specifically applicable to a G-TEDA for any taxable or income year beginning prior to the dedesignation of the G-TEDA may, to the extent the business is otherwise still eligible for those incentives, continue to avail itself of those incentives for a period equal to the remaining life of the G-TEDA. However, any business, located within any jurisdiction that comprises a G-TEDA that has been dedesignated,
