0,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.,"  Good afternoon, everybody.  Thank you for taking time on your holiday.  The purpose of this meeting is to update the Committee on financial developments over the weekend and to consider whether we want to take a policy action today.  I would like to start with a brief update on the markets from Bill Dudley and take any questions for him, and then I will introduce the issue, make a recommendation, and ask for your comments following that.  Bill, would you like to give us a short review?"
1,MR. DUDLEY.,"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Since our videoconference on January 9, the market functioning in terms of the bank term funding markets has 
generally continued to improve, with the one-month and three-month LIBOR relative 
to the overnight index swap rates coming back very sharply.  They are now as narrow 
as they’ve been since the market turmoil began.  But elsewhere in terms of market 
functioning, we started to see a step backward last week—especially late in the 
week—when we viewed the asset-backed commercial paper market beginning to 
deteriorate again, and there was some flight to quality into the Treasury bill market 
late last week. 
 
 More important, the macro outlook and broader financial market conditions have continued to deteriorate quite sharply.  The S&P 500 index, for example, fell 
5.4 percent last week; it is down almost 10 percent so far this year.  Today it fell 
another 60 points, or 4.5 percent, so that means that the cumulative decline in the 
S&P 500, if it opens near where the futures markets closed today, will be nearly 
15 percent since the start of the year.  Global stock markets were also down very 
sharply today—Monday.  Depending on where you look, the range of decline was 
anywhere from 3 percent to 7½ percent, pretty much across the board.  Corporate 
credit spreads and credit default spreads have continued to widen, and bank mark-to-
market losses and loan-loss provisions keep increasing.  The Merrill Lynch and 
Citigroup earnings announcements last week generally suggested a widening in terms 
of the scope of losses, not just in subprime but also in terms of credit card receivables 
and other loans. 
 
  A newish wrinkle here in terms of bank markdowns reflects the deterioration of some of the monoline guarantors.  Merrill Lynch, for example, announced a 
multibillion dollar charge for its exposure to ACA, which is the most impaired of the 
monoline guarantors.  The other monoline guarantors are in better shape, but they’ve 
either been downgraded, such as the case of Ambac by Fitch on Friday afternoon, or 
are under review for being downgraded by a number of different credit-rating agencies.  The problem with the monoline guarantors is that raising capital has 
become much more difficult.  Ten days ago, for example, MBIA issued 14 percent 
surplus notes, which are now trading at about 70 cents on the dollar.  It’s not clear 
how much additional capital is needed to keep the AAA rating.  The goal posts keep 
moving.  S&P, for example, raised its loss estimates on subprime mortgages about a 
week and a half ago, and this has implications for the monoline insurers in terms of 
their capital adequacy.   
 
So the bottom line is that, unless the monoline insurers raise significant additional capital soon, further rating downgrades seem very, very likely.  This has three 
potential consequences that are noteworthy.  First, in the money market space, a 
number of money market products are wrapped by the monoline guarantors, including 
variable-rate demand notes, auction-rate securities, and tender option bonds.  Some of 
these securities have liquidity support, so if the securities can’t be rolled over, they’ll 
go to the banks, and this will increase the pressure on bank balance sheets.  For those 
without liquidity support, either they will be converted to longer-dated securities, 
which the investors will be surprised to find out they are holding, or the dealers will 
have to take them back on their books to prevent the auctions from failing.  A second 
consequence from monoline guarantor downgrades would be to the municipal bond 
funds.  The loss of AAA insurance raises the question of what the retail bond 
investors do.  Do they start pulling out their money and run?  So far things are pretty 
calm on that front.  For example, last week the net asset values of some of the major 
muni bond insurance funds actually increased a bit for the week.  So there are no 
signs of a run there yet, but we haven’t really explored this fully, given the fact that 
only one major monoline guarantor has been downgraded and that happened late, late 
last week.  Third, financial institutions have to mark down the value of the 
guarantors’ insurance as their financial conditions worsen.  In contrast, the monolines 
don’t have to mark to market.  Downgrading the monolines frontloads the hit to 
capital and potentially aggravates the magnitude of the hit to capital because market 
valuations can overshoot.  So it is not trivial to transfer this risk from the monolines 
to the financial institutions given the distinction that the monolines do not have to 
mark to market but financial institutions that use their insurance do. 
 
At this point, monetary policy expectations have priced in a lot of easing over the"
2,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.,"near term.  As of Friday’s close, there were about 67 basis points priced in through 
the January meeting at the end of the month and about 110 basis points priced in 
through the March meeting (if you look at the April federal funds futures contract).  
There is likely more than that now given the decline in the equity futures market that 
we saw today.  So the markets are expecting quite a bit from the Fed.  I’ll be happy to 
take any questions, of course. 
 
  Are there questions for Bill?  President Lacker?"
3,MR. LACKER.,  Can you explain that third consequence of monoline downgrades?  I didn’t quite get that.
4,MR. DUDLEY.,"  The monoline insurers don’t have to mark to market the consequences of the deterioration in, say, the structured-finance product they insured.  All they have to do is pay out, as it is incurred, the interest that the structured-finance product can’t pay out.  So their losses are going to be realized only very gradually over a long period of time.  There is no sort of foreshortening of all that into the present.  In contrast, if a monoline guarantor gets downgraded and so the financial institution no longer has the support of that monoline guarantee, they have to write down instantaneously the value of the assets that were wrapped by that guarantee.  So it’s quite a big difference in terms of the market impact as you transfer that risk from the monoline guarantors to the financial institutions that bought that insurance."
5,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.,  Other questions for Bill?  President Hoenig.
6,MR. HOENIG.,"  Yes, Mr. Chairman.  I don’t want to get ahead of what you might be saying, but if Bill could give us a sense of what the markets are doing overseas, I would appreciate just his sense of things."
7,MR. DUDLEY.,"  Well, the market on Monday morning in Asia was down somewhere around 3, 4, or 5 percent, and it was everywhere, including some of the emerging markets that up to now had performed pretty well.  India took one of its biggest one-day hits, for example, in a very long time.  Then, we got to Europe, and the declines in Europe were actually a little bigger than the declines that we saw in Asia.  For example, the Dow Jones STOXX 50 Index, which is an index of 50 large European companies, was down 7¼ percent on Monday.  The market went down sharply at the open, it rallied back up a bit during the day, and then it came sharply down again at the close.  So for both indexes you are basically at or very close to the low for the day. Bond markets reacted as you might expect.  Bond markets rallied as people became more pessimistic about the stock market.  In the currency market, we saw the sort of normal risk- aversion behavior.  The euro underperformed, the dollar was in the middle, and the yen appreciated as people were reducing their risk appetites. I talked to some people about what was going on in Europe.  I didn’t really feel as though my contacts there were focused exclusively on the financial guarantors.  That was part of the story, but there were other parts of the story, including the idea that maybe decoupling isn’t going to happen to the degree that we hoped.  Also, part of the story was that the risks of recession in the United States were increasing.  So financial guarantors got part of the blame for the stock market decline in Asia and Europe, but that by no means was the whole story."
8,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.,"  Other questions?  If not, let me just talk about the issue here.  I was reluctant to call this meeting, both because of the holiday and because the Committee did express a preference on January 9 for not moving between regularly scheduled meetings and I accepted that judgment on January 9.  However, I think there are times when events are just moving too fast for us to wait for the regular meeting.  I know it is only a week away, but seven trading days is a long time in financial markets.  As Bill described, over the holiday, global stock markets have been falling very sharply, both in Asia and in Europe.  As he mentioned, even though the U.S. markets are closed, the S&P 500 was off about 60 points today, close to 5 percent.  That makes the cumulative decline in the S&P 500 since our last FOMC meeting 16½ percent.  Obviously, it is not our job to target stock values or to protect stock investors, but I think that this is a symptom of both sharply mounting concerns about the economy and increasing problems in credit markets. On the economy, the data and the information that we can glean from financial markets reflect a growing belief that the United States is in for a deep and protracted recession. Moreover, as we saw from the global markets today, the concern is rising that that recession will have global consequences.  Consequently, we saw, for example, an 8 percent drop today in the German stock market.  The dollar rose today, reflecting I think increasing belief that other central banks will have to follow us in cutting rates, and oil prices are down to about $87, reflecting expectations of slowing global demand.  So it is not necessarily a U.S.-only story. On the financial side, as Bill noted, a lot of things are going on.  The latest is the likely downgrade of one or more of the monoline insurers, which would cause banks and other financial institutions to have to mark down billions more of their holdings.  I think there is a general sense—I certainly feel in talking to market participants—that it is not just subprime anymore and that there are real concerns about other kinds of consumer credit—credit cards, autos, and home equity loans—and that there is fear of housing prices falling enough that contagion will infect prime mortgage loans.  There is building in the market a real dynamic of withdrawal from risk, withdrawal from normal credit extension, which I think is very worrisome. Would a rate action today, before the start of trading tomorrow, be of help?  I don’t know.  In some sense it was a lucky break that today was a holiday because in the middle of the day we got a very good read on what the markets are doing tomorrow, and so we can get ahead of things as opposed to being forced, after a couple of disastrous days, to respond.  Again, I don’t know if this would help, but I think that indicating that the Fed is on top of the situation and that we are proposing to address economic and credit risks aggressively would help.  In any case, it would at least make clear that the Fed was in touch with the situation. I think we have to take a meaningful action—something that will have an important effect.  Therefore, I am proposing a cut of 75 basis points.  I recognize that this is a very large change.  I would not do that if I thought that the size of the cut was inconsistent with our medium-term macroeconomic objectives.  Let me discuss that a few minutes. As I said to some of you, on Friday I had a briefing from Dave Stockton and his team about their Greenbook forecast for next week’s meeting.  They have not made an explicit recession call, but they do forecast very weak growth going forward.  More important, in order to get that positive economic growth, they revised down their assumed path of the federal funds rate by 100 basis points—50 basis points next week and 50 basis points in March.  That gives a cumulative decline in the staff’s fed funds assumption of 200 basis points since August, which is consistent both with the markets and with a 225 basis point decline in medium-term r*, which is an indicator of the neutral rate, as well as the optimal policy rate that they calculate.  Importantly, of course, we have lowered the funds rate only 100 basis points so far, so I think at first approximation we are about 100 basis points behind the curve—something in that general area— in terms of the neutral rate, and that itself doesn’t even take into account what I believe at this point is a legitimate need for risk management. With respect to risk management, these credit risks obviously have the potential to feed back into our financial system and to affect the economy going forward.  I hope to be able to talk next week more about a simulation the staff is working on, which shows that a severe recession would create extraordinary credit losses for our financial institutions, with implications obviously for credit extension and for financial stability.  It is just one indicator, but a paper by Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff has been circulated in the past couple of days, which compares some indicators of our economy with other major financial crises and finds that we rank at the moment among the five largest financial crises in any industrial country since World War II. Given what their indicators show, they conclude that, if we have only a mild recession in the United States, it would be a very fortunate outcome.  Now, I am not saying that this is necessarily evidence, but I am saying that there are risks and that a careful approach should allow for some easing with respect to risks.  Governor Mishkin is not here.  He is aware of this meeting, but he is on the slopes—I think in Idaho somewhere.  He has made I think a case for being more aggressive initially, trying to address the problem, and then removing accommodation as the situation calms down.  I think there is a case for doing that, given the fact that we have done 100 basis points and that we seem to have not really made a dent. Now, of course, there is also the issue of inflation.  Many of you have valid concerns about inflation.  Let me just make a few comments on that.  First, in the Greenbook, despite a 100 basis point drop in the rate assumption and the scenario that I take as being in some sense optimistic in that it avoids an outright recession, the preliminary Greenbook forecast for 2009 has total PCE inflation at 1.7 percent and core PCE inflation at 1.9 percent.  This does not take into account any disinflationary effects that would arise if we did have an NBER recession or worse.  Again, I note that we have, for example, effects working through oil prices, which the Greenbook doesn’t take into account directly.  So I think, obviously, that we have to continue to watch inflation and inflation expectations carefully.  It is very important to do so.  But at this point we are facing, potentially, a broad-based crisis.  We can no longer temporize.  We have to address this crisis.  We have to try to get it under control.  If we can’t do that, then we are just going to lose control of the whole situation. So that is my case.  I think we really have no choice but to try to get ahead of this.  A statement has been circulated.  Those of you who wish to comment on the proposal—of course, you can.  You may wish to comment on the statement as well.  But let me just stop there and see what comments the Committee has.  President Plosser?"
9,MR. PLOSSER.,"  Just as a point of clarification, I have not received the statement.  I have not had access to encrypted e-mail.  May I ask that it just be read?"
10,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.,"  Certainly.  Let me do that.  I had one word in the second paragraph—the word “broader”—which I will come to. “The Federal Open Market Committee has decided to lower its target for the federal funds rate 75 basis points to 3½ percent. The Committee took this action in view of a weakening of the economic outlook and increasing downside risks to growth.  While strains in short-term funding markets have eased somewhat, broader—add that word—financial market conditions have continued to deteriorate and credit has tightened further for some businesses and households.  Moreover, incoming information indicates a deepening of the housing contraction as well as some softening in labor markets. The Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, but it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully. Appreciable downside risks to growth remain.  The Committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act in a timely manner as needed to address those risks.” President Evans."
11,MR. EVANS.,"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I strongly support this recommendation.  At our last videoconference, I was in favor of action at that time.  The situation has deteriorated since then.  I think the macroeconomic outlook supports this type of move.  As we look at the data, we are on the edge of a more serious downturn.  It is not exactly clear how large that will be, but we ought to be pricing in at least 100 basis points of accommodation against what I think of as sort of a medium-term neutral rate of about 4½, and this is a move that takes us there.  I think the growth risks are definitely greater, and the real question after this is what it means for our meeting next week.  But I strongly support this."
12,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.,  Thank you.  President Stern.
13,MR. STERN.,"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I largely share your assessment of the situation and certainly support this action and taking it now.  What has really caught my attention is the breadth of the weakness of the incoming data and the extent of the financial problems, some of which Bill Dudley covered.  I don’t have the sense at this point, given both the nature of the incoming data and the state of many of the financial markets we pay attention to, that there is a lot of latent or underlying strength in the economy.  So that affects my view of the outlook as well, and I think it is important that we move aggressively, decisively, and in a timely way. Of course, the inflation numbers haven’t been all that I might have hoped for, and even core inflation has been running a little higher than I thought it would.  But even if we were in some sort of more formal inflation-targeting regime—and, of course, we are not—I have always assumed and always argued that, when you are confronting these kinds of conditions, you would deal with that situation as effectively as you can first and return to your inflation objective when conditions permitted.  So I don’t have any trouble taking such aggressive action at this point."
14,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.,  Thank you.  President Yellen.
15,MS. YELLEN.,"  Thank you.  I strongly support your proposal for a 75 basis point funds rate cut today, and I like the proposed wording of the statement.  The outlook has deteriorated, not only since December but since our conference call.  The downside risks have clearly increased.  I think the risk of a severe recession and credit crisis is unacceptably high, and it is being clearly priced now into not only domestic but also global markets.  Even so, I put the stance, as best I can judge it, of monetary policy within the neutral range.  Policy should be clearly accommodative.  We also need a cushion against severe downside risks.  We need strong action, and your speech has prepared the markets for actions of this sort.  At this point, they are expecting at our next meeting more than 50 percent odds of a 75 basis point cut.  An intermeeting move will be a surprise, but I think it will show that we get it and we recognize we have been behind the curve.  I think it will be assumed with this statement and action today that we will move somewhat further as well at our next meeting.  That is something we should recognize—the statement creates that expectation."
16,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.,  Thank you.  President Rosengren.
17,MR. ROSENGREN.,"  I, too, strongly support reducing the federal funds rate 75 basis points.  I am very concerned about financial market conditions detailed earlier by Bill.  It is widely viewed in the business community that we are slipping into a recession.  Problems with consumer debt are growing.  I am concerned not only that we might be in, or about to be in, a recession.  I am concerned also how severe a recession could be.  It is time to take decisive and aggressive action, and I agree that, even with this cut, downside risks remain.  Thank you."
18,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.,  Thank you.  President Poole.
19,MR. POOLE.,"  Thank you.  I accept all the discussion about the risks of recession and the risks of the financial markets.  All those are relevant to what we do next week.  But the key issue for me is what we get by acting now rather than nine days from now.  I note that the stock market has declined, despite the fact that the market has built in the expectation of 50 basis points, with some probability of 75.  If we do today pretty much exactly what is expected of us nine days from now, it is not clear that we are going to accomplish a lot that is positive, and I believe that we run the risk of upsetting things in a couple of ways. First of all, whenever we act between meetings, we set a precedent, and what this will do in the future, maybe even in the very near future, is that whenever we have a stock market decline of this magnitude, if we get some more of them—and we could easily—or whenever we have some bad economic data—and we certainly could have some—there will be speculation in the market as to whether the FOMC is going to jump in with an intermeeting policy action.  So we have to be confident in our own minds that we are not setting a precedent that we will live to regret. Second, this action will not be viewed in the marketplace as anything other than a direct response to the stock market.  I understand the comments about the other strains in the financial markets.  Although the thing that we have most commonly pointed to, and it has occasioned the most market discussion, has to do with the behavior of the LIBOR rate, LIBOR seems to have settled down.  It is trading below fed funds, and the further out you go in the future, the lower is LIBOR.  So it seems to me that that situation has largely returned to normal. So before I am willing to support, I need to hear compelling arguments as to what we gain from acting today rather than nine days from now and what the risks of acting today are.  I think there are downside risks in acting today rather than nine days from now, and to me that needs to be the focus of our discussion.  I agree that the economy is weak, and I agree that there are a lot of problems in the financial markets.  Thank you."
20,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.,  Thank you.  Who is next?  Would anyone else like to speak?  Vice Chairman.
21,VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.,"  Mr. Chairman, of course, I support your recommendation.  I think it is the right thing to do.  Even with this move, I think we are likely to have to move significantly further.  It is hard to know how much more and what the optimal timing of further actions is going to be.  It is very important, in the context of a move, that we signal—as your statement does—that we will do what is necessary to provide a meaningful degree of accommodation, a meaningful degree of insurance against a more adverse set of financial and economic outcomes.  If we were to wait until the meeting, we would be taking just too much risk.  I think it would be irresponsible to take the risk that we would see a substantial further deterioration in confidence and in market prices, which would do substantially more damage to market functioning than we have witnessed so far. I think you said on January 9, Mr. Chairman, that the risk we have to worry about is not so much that we have simply a mild, short, and shallow recession but that we face a much deeper and more protracted economic downturn with much more damage to the financial system that would ultimately require, if it were to happen, much more action in terms of monetary policy with perhaps more-adverse consequences for future incentives and for the economy as a whole.  I think that that is a risk we have to worry about.  It is very hard to judge what the probability of that risk is.  None of us can know for sure what the next nine days would be like if we did not act.  None of us can know the probability that the market will work through this stuff on its own. It is a matter of judgment, and I think your judgment on this is right.  I strongly support it.  I just would say again, although I don’t think any of us can support this with hard, quantifiable evidence, that conditions are so fragile and so tenuous now that by not acting tomorrow morning we would be taking an irresponsible risk that we would see substantial further erosion in confidence.  That would put us in a much weaker position to mitigate these risks going forward."
22,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.,  President Hoenig.
23,MR. HOENIG.,"  Yes, Mr. Chairman.  I am troubled by this, I will admit.  I understand the arguments, and it is difficult to argue against dodging a crisis.  It is a very daunting thought to think about a crisis that you might have avoided had you just taken certain actions.  I would echo Bill Poole a bit in terms of understanding what we will get out of this and how we will deal with backing away from this in the future because part of the reason we have the problem today, of course, is the last crisis.  The desire is to intervene, to get the market rates down, and to bring confidence; but then our ability to pull out of that is compromised because we can’t be sure in an uncertain world of how strongly the economy might be coming out of something.  Therefore, we often delay and create the next issue that we have to deal with—as we are today. So I am troubled.  I know the risk coming in tomorrow.  I know we are being driven heavily by these markets.  At the same time, I think doing an intermeeting move commits us to another move down the way.  It will be hard to stay at rates that are not going to at least invite another series of problems down the road because I see us at 3 percent by nine days from now. So how do we deal with that?  I would at least like to hear some discussion as we consider this pretty substantial action tonight.  Those are my comments."
24,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.,  Thank you.  President Lacker.
25,MR. LACKER.,"  I can support a 75 basis point cut in the funds rate this month, Mr. Chairman.  I had been thinking of something less.  The data last week were clearly negative, clearly disappointing, so I could support 75 at our meeting.  Like President Poole, I have real reservations about moving now rather than waiting until our meeting.  I think that in the situation this is inevitably going to be viewed as a reaction to the falloff in equity markets.  Interpreters are going to take into account that we could have moved last week, after the slew of real data— Thursday afternoon, for example, after the housing report—or we could have waited until our meeting ten days from now.  I worry about the message that this tactical choice sends about our strategy.  I worry about what it says about what drives our reaction function and what we believe that we can control or offset.  I share President Poole’s concern that what we gain isn’t clear.  I can appreciate the possibility of financial market fragility, but I don’t see the level of the funds rate as real closely tied to conditions of fragility.  I don’t think a funds rate change is going to save the monolines.  I don’t think it is going to save financial institutions from the monolines. So I have reservations and would rather wait until our meeting.  But I can support moving 75."
26,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.,  Thank you.  President Lockhart.
27,MR. LOCKHART.,"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In the earlier discussion on January 9, as I recall, I not only supported a move but suggested that I would support an intermeeting move if the conditions merited, and I do think they merit it.  I am really in the same camp as President Geithner.  I am not sure I see what is to be gained by waiting another eight or nine days.  I think the psychology here is bordering on, shall we say, a spiral quality.  A preemptive move like this—preemptive on two dimensions, the rate dimension and the timing dimension—has a shot at changing the overall psychology of the moment, including perhaps even creating an atmosphere in which support for the monolines, if they are having trouble raising capital, might very well be a more rational decision on the part of some investor. I think we would appear much less panicky than we might have on January 9.  We are not doing this in combination with the TAF.  The TAF actually appears to have done its work pretty well, and the need for the TAF may be diminishing.  Not much more data will come in the next few days, if I have my schedule correct.  I think we are at a kind of juncture now where the spillover from the financial markets is not really much debatable; it is very clearly happening, with risk of a dynamic that feeds off itself.  So I am very supportive of this move, and that is really my position.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman."
28,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.,  Thank you.  President Fisher.
29,MR. FISHER.,"  There are some pros to moving now, and there are some cons.  Clearly, one of the pros is that we would have the element of surprise.  It is a holiday.  We have the benefit of some knowledge of new data and what has happened in the market starting in Asia and rolling through Europe, which Bill walked us through.  I do have some concerns, however, Mr. Chairman.  I know you know what they are.  I articulated them in a speech in Philadelphia, and we discussed these a bit.  I have basically the same concerns that President Poole, President Hoenig, and President Lacker have.  The question is, What do we get for this?  What expectations do we build in for future decisionmaking?  My biggest concern, however, is that I have yet to see convincing evidence that we are seeing movement on the inflation front.  If we were to cut rates to this level today, as of now, in terms of the headline CPI and PCE numbers, we would have a negative real rate of interest, and I don’t understand quite fully what the consequence of that would be.  The projections in the Greenbook are just that—they are projections.  They can be right, and they can be wrong, as thoughtfully as they are constructed. Unlike President Rosengren, although I am only about 30 percent of my way through my CEO calls in preparing for the meeting, I don’t hear a widespread expectation of recession.  I do hear a concern about slowing down, and we have seen that in all of the indexes that I like to talk about in the meetings from the credit card payables, delinquencies in payments, the Baltic index, et cetera, et cetera.  But the words “severe recession” I have yet to hear from the lips of anybody but those in the housing business, and for them, it gets more severe with each passing moment. So I am not convinced of the economic case, and yet I can see where there are some benefits to moving now.  The real question is, What do we do next?  If the markets react by blowing us off, does that mean that we will be expected to move aggressively at the next meeting and then the next meeting after that?  Or as President Poole has mentioned, does that mean that we will have to have some more interim meetings?  I am a little worried about being trapped by this concept of being behind the curve.  There is a fine line between being behind the curve and what may be an overreaction.  But, Mr. Chairman, I don’t have a vote at this meeting, and I would just ask you to consider the arguments that have been put forward by Mr. Poole, Mr. Hoenig, and Mr. Lacker and the ones that I have just given.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
30,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.,  Thank you.  President Pianalto.
31,MS. PIANALTO.,"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support your proposal for a 75 basis point reduction in the fed funds rate today.  At the time of our last call, I was hesitant about moving because it was in advance of some important data.  Obviously, we got those data, and they were very weak.  Financial conditions, as many have indicated, have also deteriorated.  My conversations with the bankers in my District indicate that the earnings reports that are coming out will demonstrate that problems have spread beyond just the mortgage sector.  They are also seeing deterioration in credit card and other consumer debt.  I think that it is important that we move in a timely and an aggressive way.  I don’t think that there is much to gain by waiting another week.  In this environment, I do believe that we should make every effort to make sure that we are more accommodative and not stay inadvertently restrictive, as the evidence suggests we are today.  So I do support moving 75 basis points today.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
32,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.,  Thank you.  President Plosser.
33,MR. PLOSSER.,"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think we are in a very, very difficult position.  I don’t want to reiterate many of the points that have been already made.  I certainly appreciate and am sympathetic with the point of view that markets are fragile.  Market expectations, in terms of what they seem to be building into the path of the economy going forward, seem to me extraordinarily volatile and pessimistic.  I am very concerned about that. That bothers me.  But at the same time I also am very concerned about the expectations this sets. While the U.S. market was closed today, we have heard what has gone on in the foreign markets. I am very concerned that we are going to be interpreted as reacting to the stock market declines, and I think my concern is that lowering the funds rate terribly rapidly with intermeeting moves is going to set up a dynamic that is going to drive us into more and more of these and drive the markets into expecting more and more from us.  It is not clear to me that the fragility that exists in the market in fact will be solved by rapid cuts in the funds rate.  I share President Lacker’s concern that it is not clear that lowering the funds rate is a solution to the problem of the monoline insurance companies or others. Having said that, I nonetheless would certainly be supportive of a very dramatic action at our regularly scheduled meeting.  Frankly, I am very torn right now as to whether to support this intermeeting cut.  My gut instinct tells me “no,” but I also have to recognize the views shared by a number of our colleagues who are concerned about the fragility of the markets and the signals we are sending.  If we decide to go through with this today, I think that we will find ourselves in a very tough position at our next meeting as to how much more will be expected from us and at what rate.  President Poole or President Lacker pointed out that it was partly our aggressive rate- cutting in some periods that helped foster some of this, and we may be setting ourselves up for another fall.  I share Governor Mishkin’s view that if, in fact, we are to get aggressive, we also have to be willing to take it back when times change.  I understand that view, and I can live with it, except the history of this institution is that we haven’t been very aggressive in doing that or demonstrating our ability to do that. So I have a lot of concern and caution about this move.  I think it is going to affect expectations of us as we move forward, and I think we need to be realistic about what it is we are buying with this.  I am not sure we are buying very much.  Maybe we will calm some market nerves.  If so, that would be great, and it may be of short-run benefit, at least over the next nine days.  I worry what it is going to mean for us over the next nine months as we move forward.  So those are my views.  I am not a voting member at this meeting, but I just wanted to share those views.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
34,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.,"  Thank you.  President Poole, did you want to intervene?"
35,MR. POOLE.,"  Yes, if I may.  I have a question of fact first and then a further question. Do we know at all what the ECB and the Bank of England are considering given that the markets were open and they are the ones who have seen markets and know what is going on there today?"
36,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.,"  We don’t know what they are considering, but just to anticipate my response to some of these comments, I think the situation in the United States, the fundamental situation, is much more severe at this juncture than in Europe or the United Kingdom.  The basis for this move is not to calm markets per se but rather to get the funds rate closer to where it ought to be on fundamental grounds.  But to answer your question, I don’t know what the ECB and the Bank of England are contemplating.  You had a second question."
37,MR. POOLE.,"  I think the market’s view, then, is going to be that we are responding to the markets abroad.  Our own market has been closed.  I understand the futures market, but there are a lot of people who don’t understand the futures market or know of its existence.  So I think that the investor on the street, if you will, will be saying that we are responding to foreign markets.  In terms of the problems in the financial markets, the monoline insurers and others, that is a problem of the capital of those firms.  Cutting the funds rate does nothing to build up capital for those firms.  I still come back to the point that I do not see a convincing argument for acting today rather than nine days from now, and I see lots of downside to acting today because of the problems that it is going to create for us in the future.  I really believe that, and I just don’t see the argument for acting today."
38,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.,  Governor Kohn.
39,MR. KOHN.,"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I strongly support your proposal.  As I noted in our conference call a couple of weeks ago, I think our reaction to the incoming data and to the change in financial conditions, even as of a couple of weeks ago, was much smaller than it needed to be to stabilize the economy.  We had a long way to go, and the situation has deteriorated since then, a little bit on the data side—the consumption data were a little weaker than we expected—but much more in the financial markets.  We have a vicious cycle in housing between the financial markets and the housing markets, where the decline in the housing markets is feeding into the credit markets, which is feeding back on the housing market.  I think there is evidence, as others have cited, that it is spreading geographically a bit to other countries, which means that the export support that we were counting on may not be as strong as it was, and spreading to other markets like the consumer credit markets.  I agree that the equity markets per se aren’t our goal, but declines in equity prices destroy wealth.  I think they are symptomatic, as you indicated, Mr. Chairman, of a fear and a declining confidence in where this economy is going.  That dynamic of declining confidence and growing fear argues for early action despite a number of reasons to wait for the next meeting. I agree with President Poole that no one can be certain what the market reaction will be and what kind of responses we will get now and in the future.  We could look panicky.  We could set up expectations in the future that we would regret.  But I think the greater risk would be in not acting.  Given the dynamic out there, living through another nine days before the next meeting has a very high degree of risk that we could come into that meeting in a very, very adverse spot in terms of where the markets are and what is expected of us.  So there is no guarantee of success here.  That is for sure.  But if I were going to place my bets—and I guess I am as a voting member of the Committee—I would place it on acting now rather than later. President Lockhart talked about the potential positive effects on psychology.  I think that is part of it.  There are also just the normal channels through which monetary policy works on the economy.  Lowering interest rates will help in terms of asset prices, and it will help financing costs; and given the risk of waiting, I think we should get to that right away.  I agree that it is not going to do anything directly for the monolines or for the other institutions that need capital.  But part of what is driving this fear and eroding confidence is the concern about recession.  I think lowering interest rates, doing it promptly, and doing it emphatically with 75 basis points, as well as acting through the usual channels, will help ameliorate that fear. In terms of taking it back, the point that President Hoenig made, I think the history of what we have done is pretty complicated and more complex maybe than that we are always too late taking it back.  If we were always too late, we would have seen an upward trend in inflation. But we haven’t.  We have seen a downward trend in inflation for the past 25 years.  So it seems to me that the proof of the pudding is in the inflation eating, and I don’t think we have been reluctant to—I mean, yes, you can argue that we should have done it one meeting sooner or that sort of thing.  That is all 20/20 hindsight.  You know, you can always make that argument.  But I think basically monetary policy has accomplished its objectives pretty darn well over this period, reacting to financial market distress and then taking it back when we see the distress being alleviated.  I think, President Hoenig, if we keep our eye on the inflation forecast, if we make sure that we are forward-looking in that regard, that we will take it back in a timely way.  Even if we get started a meeting or two too late, we can move up faster after we start.  So I don’t think our history is so unambiguous that we are always late taking things back.  I don’t think the results support that kind of assertion. I agree with you, Mr. Chairman, that we cannot take our eyes off inflation, particularly inflation expectations.  If we had a build in inflation expectations, that would set into motion a very serious and destructive dynamic, especially with the dollar.  But I do think that declining resource utilization, a soft economy, even if it’s not in recession, will exert competitive pressures on both workers and businesses as they consider raising prices.  Our focus right now, as several of you have remarked, given the risk to the economy, must be on financial stability and its implications for the economy.  That is where we need to focus our attention at the moment. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
40,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.,  Thank you.  Governor Warsh.
41,MR. WARSH.,"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me just make a few brief points.  First, during the discussions on this call, we have described these financial markets as fragile.  That strikes me as rather euphemistic for what we have been witnessing really since the first of this year, particularly what is being witnessed overseas today.  The losses appear to be self- reinforcing.  Panic appears to be begetting further pullbacks by investors, retail and institutional alike.  There seems to be continued interest in the safest currencies, and this pullback strikes me as quite nondiscriminate, geographically and in terms of sectors, companies, and even entire asset classes.  Certainly, we shouldn’t be responding to those moves unless, when we think about our credibility, we think about it both with respect to our inflation-fighting credibility and, I think as Governor Kohn just said, our financial stability credibility.  I think the standard for moving between meetings is a very high one; but looking at the evidence, both in the financial markets and in the real economy, and thinking about our own credibility, my sense is that we rather convincingly meet that standard. My judgment would be, if we chose not to act today, that we would in all likelihood not make it until next week.  There can’t be a ton of conviction that by virtue of 75 basis points today we are going to redress some of this fear and some of the psychology that is working against us in the markets.  But just because we don’t have a panacea, just because monetary policy can’t solve the monoline problem and can’t solve some of the other problems, doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t be doing our part.  It strikes me that by taking action today we are doing our part.  We are showing the financial markets and the real businesses that we do get it. Speaking for myself, I am glad that the interbank funding markets are working better.  That puts them in a better position to take more advantage of changes in monetary policy.  Through the TAF and through time they are now lending to each other.  But based on what has happened in the last several days, it doesn’t look as though they are going to be lending to many others.  So our action today needs to be focused very much on that front. With all that said, Mr. Chairman—and recognizing how quickly the decoupling hypothesis seems to have raced away from these markets as quickly as it found its way into their collective wisdom—we look to emerging markets and look to markets here in the United States. I think our actions today will go some small way to ensure that markets come back to a more realistic assessment, but we shouldn’t fool ourselves that somehow we in any way are going to be solving this problem between now and the next time we meet.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
42,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.,  Thank you.  Governor Kroszner.
43,MR. KROSZNER.,"  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  I think it is very clear that the numbers have weakened significantly from where we were before.  In some sense, the pieces are starting to fall in the puzzle, and we were uncertain before—we are still uncertain—but there is a lot more evidence of significant downside risks.  So things, unfortunately, have been clarified on that side.  We have also gotten some data that are not particularly welcome on inflation, which suggests that there are still some challenges there, both in headline and in core.  At the last meeting, a lot of us focused a lot on the potential for a regime switch.  We haven’t really talked about that much here, but I think this evidence suggests that there is much higher probability of a fairly rapid shift from a growth state to a recession state.  That is being reflected in the financial market, so it is just a different way of saying similar things that the Chairman, Governor Kohn, and others of you have said. I think Bill would also say that the credit default swap spreads on a number of the financial institutions have been going up, even as some of the liquidity issues have been coming down.  There are very strong concerns about significant losses coming down the line—concerns not only about the monolines but also, as the Chairman said, about losses just because of the problems in the consumer sector—increasing delinquencies in a variety of areas, not just in subprime mortgages.  That is going to put a lot of stress on bank balance sheets.  Even though the banks have been nimble in bringing in a lot of capital, they have also had astonishingly large losses.  If they continue to have these losses going forward, they just will not be able to churn out the funding that is necessary to keep an economy growing certainly at anything that is close to potential, probably nothing that is close to a positive rate of growth. So it seems that it is sensible to buy some insurance and buy it through taking a bold, decisive action now.  The question, of course, is whether we do that now or whether we do that in nine days.  People have talked about the tradeoff that we have between the value of acting now and averting the possibility of very negative outcomes over the next nine days and some concern about developing a bad expectations dynamic and problems of people thinking that we are responding to the equity markets in and of themselves, not what the equity markets are signaling about the real economy.  But I think things are different now than they were earlier in the month, when I was not very supportive of moving at that time.  First, we now have more data in a variety of areas, and we have the concerns about the monolines.  We have a more substantive basis on which to move, so it doesn’t look as though we are responding to just one particular thing; the pieces are there together.  Second, there is a much clearer foundation from the Chairman’s testimony and speech, in which he made it very clear that we would be thinking about and seriously contemplating bold action.  So now there is a foundation for this.  This is not just coming out of the blue or coming out of some rumors in the market.  I think that is a very different situation from the one we had before.  Third, I think it is actually beneficial that we have the meeting coming up in nine days.  That gives us an opportunity to refine the message fairly quickly if we feel we need to and to take further actions if we need to.  So I come out, on balance, thinking that the risks are too high not to act now.  I acknowledge some of those downside risks, but I see that there are very strong benefits to acting now. But I do hear some of the concerns that people have raised, and I had some of these concerns also, particularly with respect to inflation.  I might suggest that in the last paragraph in the proposed FOMC statement, which I am fine with, perhaps a way of showing a little more concern about some of the inflation issues is in the second half of that sentence, where you say “but it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully,” to say instead “but it will be necessary to continue to monitor those inflation developments carefully.”  That might buy us a little there because the statement is a fairly large move away from what we have said before. This phrase is about the only one that we have repeated from before, and I think strengthening that phrase may be beneficial.  But I am supportive of the statement as is.  Perhaps it could be improved with a little strengthening there to address some of the concerns, but I am very much supportive of the overall 75 basis point move now.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
44,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.,"  Thank you.  President Hoenig, does a language change on inflation help you at all?"
45,MR. HOENIG.,"  It is, I guess, helpful, but let me ask this.  A point that was made earlier, when you said that we are moving to where we need to be, in terms of the real rate, taking total inflation, we are moving to real rates that are negative.  I am fairly confident that, while this is a bold move, it is also a precursor to another move a week or nine days from now, which would put us in an even more negative position, when we are projecting the economy to be slowing and when, in fact, total inflation is above—currently at least, year over year—4 percent.  I understand the concerns about the markets and people’s uncertainty.  But we are taking these very dramatic actions right now, more perhaps than what we need when you say “where interest rates need to be.”  If we were to go 50 basis points now and 50 basis points at the next meeting, we are still moving down, but we are taking it in a more measured form.  I am not convinced that isn’t a better way of going, given where we are with the economy and given where we are with our projections looking forward.  That is really something that maybe you could at least address— the negative levels of the real rate in terms of your comfort going forward and where we need to be."
46,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.,"  All right.  Thank you.  Let me make a few comments. Thank everyone for your input and your concerns, which I appreciate.  This is a very, very difficult situation, and no one can know exactly how this is going to work out.  But let me try to respond to a few points that were made.  First of all, as I indicated earlier, I would not be proposing this if I didn’t think that we were seriously behind the curve in terms of economic growth and the financial situation.  I said that on January 9, and since then the markets and the data have only gotten significantly worse.  I do believe that we are at least 100 basis points behind the curve in terms of neutrality, and so I am quite comfortable with this order of magnitude of move.  Frankly, I think the evidence is very much in favor of it. With respect to what the real rate is, I would combine my response to you with a comment to President Fisher, which is that real rates depend on expected inflation, not past inflation.  Inflation is a lagging indicator.  We cannot wait until inflation is down before we begin to act.  We have to look at the future.  We have seen oil prices down $10 already.  We just have to make a judgment.  With the economy slowing and with oil prices likely to moderate, the best guess is that inflation will be well controlled going forward.  If that is not the case, we can begin to address it.  But I do believe that, from a forecast viewpoint, we don’t have a negative real interest rate, and we don’t necessarily have inflation above 4 percent. I would like to address the issue of the lesson of 2001.  I don’t think that the problem with 2001 was the rate at which the interest rate was cut.  The interest rate was cut more than 500 basis points, including three intermeeting moves of 50 basis points each in 2001. Nevertheless, at the end of that episode, inflation was too low, which is evidence I think that in some sense the response was even inefficiently slow.  Not that they could have necessarily done better, but clearly it was not the cut itself that led to inflation problems.  Governor Kohn’s points notwithstanding, and it was very difficult to know ex ante what was right, if there is a concern there it has to do with how quickly the rate was raised starting in 2004 going forward, when the economy was already on a growth path.  I think we have learned from that.  I think we will be very sensitive to that. Let me just add that I do intend to be talking more about the outlook and about policy.  I am sure that I will do my best to communicate where I think we are and how we are going to manage policy going forward.  I have talked specifically about the need to be aggressive in the short run, particularly when financial stability is at stake.  So again, my fundamental point is that we are behind the curve.  We need to do something to get up there. Why does that help markets?  Well, I think there are issues of psychology and dynamics and damage that could be done if we let the markets twist and turn for another nine days.  But the fundamentals are also involved.  The markets essentially—in their incredible efficiency—are bringing into the present concerns about very bad outcomes that might happen in the future. With fair value accounting, mark to market, and all of those things, the risk that house prices might fall 20 or 30 percent, even the small risk, is affecting today’s credit ratings and credit markdowns.  We can help the markets in a fundamental sense by assuring them that we are aware of these risks and that, though we are not going to necessarily stop a slowdown, we will do our best to minimize the tail risks of a really bad outcome that are right now driving today’s market reactions.  That would help the monoline insurers in the sense that, if the markets become convinced that those risks are much smaller, then the obligations of the monolines insurers will be less, and the willingness to advance capital might be greater. Again, if I thought that we were where we should be and this was just a question of placating the markets, I would not be here talking to you.  But I think that we need to move, and if we move now, we will get a bonus in terms of at least some hope of reducing the fear and the uncertainty that is currently in the markets.  So I do think it matters whether we move today or move nine days from now.  I recognize the risks, but in the two years that I have been here in this position, we have not moved intermeeting.  We waited a long time to move in September after our intermeeting statement.  I don’t think that we are trigger happy.  I don’t think we are perceived as trigger happy.  I think that we need to be catching up to where the right interest rate is, and that is the essence of the issue.  I guess that is all I have to say. As I said, Governor Mishkin is not here.  For what it is worth, he authorized me to say that he supports the action and the statement.  We are currently at a very critical juncture.  We are being watched very carefully.  We have to demonstrate our willingness to address these very, very serious risks.  I think we ought to go ahead and take this step, and I hope that you can support this action.  Are there any other comments?  President Hoenig."
47,MR. HOENIG.,"  Mr. Chairman, I hear you, and I appreciate your concerns.  I do understand that there is a psychology in the market that is having its effect.  I think if we make this statement as strong as we can about the need to watch inflation, and if we understand among ourselves that, as we take this action today and the follow-up actions that I am certain we are going to take, we will watch these inflation numbers, including broad asset values—I know we don’t prick bubbles and that sort of thing, but watching these broad asset-price movements—that would be very, very important, at least to think about.  I do not wish to be dissenting on this, as troubled as I am about it.  I do understand the psychology of it.  For those reasons, I am willing to go along with this.  But I worry about our ability to deal with reversal as this takes place, especially given where our projections for growth are right now and my concern that we already have inflation above 4 percent.  So I defer to you at this point.  I would vote for it because I think the psychology of the marketplace is, of course, rather fragile, and I will leave it at that.  Thank you."
48,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.,  Did you want to accept Governor Kroszner’s suggestion?
49,MR. HOENIG.,  Yes.  I think the strongest language as we can give would make me much more comfortable.
50,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.,"  Okay.  Governor Kroszner’s suggestion was to say, “The Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, but it will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.”  Does that work for everybody?  All right.  If there are no further comments, I would like to call the roll, please."
51,MS. DANKER.,"  I will read the directive and then the statement and call the roll.  “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee, in the immediate future, seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with reducing the federal funds rate to an average of around 3½ percent.” The statement goes, “The Federal Open Market Committee has decided to lower its target for the federal funds rate 75 basis points to 3½ percent. The Committee took this action in view of a weakening of the economic outlook and increasing downside risks to growth.  While strains in short-term funding markets have eased somewhat, broader financial market conditions have continued to deteriorate and credit has tightened further for some businesses and households.  Moreover, incoming information indicates a deepening of the housing contraction as well as some softening in labor markets. The Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, but it will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully. Appreciable downside risks to growth remain.  The Committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act in a timely manner as needed to address those risks.” Chairman Bernanke  Yes 
  Vice Chairman Geithner Yes 
  President Evans  Yes 
  President Hoenig  Yes 
  Governor Kohn  Yes 
  Governor Kroszner  Yes 
  President Poole  No"
52,MR. POOLE.,"  And you could add this sentence of explanation, “President Poole does not believe that current market conditions justify policy action before the regularly scheduled meeting next week.”"
53,MS. DANKER.,"  Thank you. President Rosengren  Yes 
  Governor Warsh  Yes Thank you."
54,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.,"  Okay.  Thank you very much.  Again, I am sorry to interrupt your holiday, and we will see you next week in Washington.  Thank you.  The meeting is adjourned. END OF MEETING slowly through the rest of the economy as we move forward.  We have revised up in our estimates the fourth-quarter real GDP numbers, and I think that is important to note even though I know our risks overall are elevated for growth, given some of the data coming in.  Job growth came in disappointingly.  It did so also in September, and it was revised up significantly after that.  I don’t know if the numbers will be revised up, but I would like to go cautiously, recognizing that they have been revised up in the past.  I think there are tail risks.  There is an important risk of the economy slowing, perhaps going into recession.  I think that there is an elevated risk of the inflation numbers continuing to creep up as they have over the past several months.  If these inflation numbers continue to rise as we decrease interest rates, there is a very serious cost that will have a very significant detrimental effect on the economy in the long run, which we need to keep sight of. My concern—as others have expressed, but it is a very serious concern on my part—is that we say we can reverse the policy position or raise interest rates later.  But it is extremely difficult, and understandably so, because the earlier actions will still be having an effect while the economy shows a slowing.  When it starts to pick up, we won’t be sure, just as now, whether we really are going to accelerate and whether the economy is going to pick up.  So we delay in reversing those actions, understandably so.  So that is why I want to be very cautious about coming down with our interest rates because we will be very cautious going up with our interest rates on the other side of that. I am very pleased that you have not put an actual proposal on an action today.  I would be very uncomfortable with that.  I think we need to have a full discussion with more information before we commit to any kind of interest rate moves at our month-end meeting.  I understand the risk, but I think it requires a lot of analysis as we look both at inflation and what that may mean to us if it’s rising and at the real danger of a recession.  Thank you."
55,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.,  President Poole.
56,MR. POOLE.,"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I put a very high weight on policy regularity, and I believe that improved regularity has had a lot to do with policy success in the last quarter- century.  But it is worth discussing this for just a minute because of some of the issues you will have to face in the context of signaling.  If we were to cut rates today in an intermeeting action, immediately the market would be wondering what happens on January 30.  Are they going to just stand pat on no change, then, on January 30, or will there be more?  Those issues would be very difficult to resolve by any of us.  We would not want to make a flat statement that we would rule out further action on January 30.  On the other hand, it would be very uncomfortable in explaining what that would be.  So we would increase volatility in the markets and increase questions about our policy strategy and policy direction.  So I think it is wise not to act today.  I think we should reserve those actions for days or conditions when immediate action is required that can’t wait three weeks until the next regular meeting. Now, in terms of the signaling issue—and I share all the concerns that have been expressed both about inflation and about the state of the real economy—next week we get important information on the real economy.  We get retail sales and industrial production.  We also get housing starts and permits and the PPI and the CPI.  One reason for maintaining a policy strategy that focuses on reserving the decision to the time of the regularly scheduled meeting is that we can say that at that time we will incorporate all the information at hand and not try to make a judgment in advance of that information when we don’t really have to reach that judgment.  If today were the regularly scheduled meeting, I could support 50 basis points for the reasons that people have been saying.  But it’s not a regularly scheduled meeting, so you’re going to have the same problem in terms of signaling that we would have if we were to make an intermeeting decision.  Now, you could avoid this issue by talking about baseball, I guess, or some other subject; but, in fact, that would be totally inappropriate, so you’re going to have to say something.  You can’t be totally noncommittal.  If you look at the options market, there is apparently a 0.6 probability of a 50 basis point cut on January 30, when we make that announcement.  I would certainly not favor trying to nudge that dramatically one way or the other.  It seems to me the most important thing to communicate is the overall strategy that we follow.  If you were to quite deliberately nudge that a lot higher, trying to push that probability to 1.0, then you could be—we don’t know, but you could be and we could be—in a very uncomfortable position if we got outsized increases much higher than anticipated in the inflation numbers that come next week.  Indeed, you could have upside surprises in the real economy numbers as well.  Then, having almost committed ourselves to the 50 basis points on January 30, we would be in the very uncomfortable position of how we take that away.  So it seems to me that the signaling strategy should be to concentrate on the way in which we reach decisions by incorporating the best information that we can gather and the most thorough analysis that we can apply to the problem and by making the decision at the time that we have the regularly scheduled meeting. If the data on the real economy continue the trend that we have already seen and if the inflation numbers are more or less as expected, the market is going to bid up that probability of a 50 basis point cut.  If we then reach exactly the same conclusion, we will have a very good synchronization of our policy and market expectations.  It seems to me that what we don’t want to do is produce a signal that then produces a risk of an immediate conflict between that signal and the incoming data.  Thank you."
57,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.,  Thank you.  Governor Kohn.
58,MR. KOHN.,"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I certainly share your concern that the current federal funds rate is too high.  You said that you thought we had about offset the effects of tighter credit and declining house prices on demand.  I’m not so sure that we have actually done enough to make that offset.  Certainly, if you look at the staff forecast, we haven’t.  They have the unemployment rate rising to 5¼ percent, half a point over the NAIRU, at the current funds rate, which suggests to me that the current funds rate is substantially above neutral, not at neutral.  If you look at the market—and, President Fisher, I assure you I am not going to get pushed around by the market—I do think the market is telling you that there are a lot of people out there who think that the funds rate has to drop 100-plus basis points more, and they don’t think that will be consistent with a pick up in inflation.  Now, they could be wrong.  I’m sure they probably are and often are.  But I think there is some signal there about the degree of pessimism out there about underlying demand that we shouldn’t throw away entirely just because it is coming from the market. So in my view, policy is probably still restrictive rather than neutral.  I don’t think we fully adjusted to the deteriorating condition we saw in December.  What we saw then was that the credit constriction had spread and would be bigger and more prolonged than we had thought previously.  We saw a steeper, more intense housing decline, with multiplier–accelerator effects, and wealth effects on the decline in house prices.  We saw the beginning of spillovers to other sectors, and I don’t think our 25 basis points really adjusted to all that new information. Moreover, the incoming information, although it hasn’t lowered the near-term GDP, does imply weaker growth going forward.  With regard to the labor market, it is true that it is one month, but it is three different sources of data—the household survey, the establishment survey, and the initial claims—all telling us the same thing.  Now, we will get more information over the next couple of weeks on at least the initial claims part of that and the continuing claims.  I think we should treat the labor market information as more than just one series for one month.  It’s three series for one month, and there is probably a little more weight there.  In addition, the new orders and the ISM survey, housing, and stock market wealth have declined substantially since the meeting.  So I would say, obviously, we have no insurance.  I’m not even sure we’re at neutral, and I see the downside risks that you, Mr. Chairman, Dave Stockton, and many others have talked about, particularly from the credit markets and credit conditions. I agree that the inflation situation is somewhat concerning.  Now, some people have cited the increase in the staff’s inflation forecast for 2008 of 0.4 percentage point; but of course that’s the energy price situation.  I think so far through this cycle the feed-through of energy prices into core inflation has been pretty darn low.  The staff has built in a little here.  Inflation expectations do remain anchored.  To be sure, the core inflation numbers came in a little higher, so they’re a little worrisome, too.  I think there is going to be less pressure on resources than we thought. The unemployment rate is higher, capacity utilization will be lower, and I think the competitive pressures are going to constrain compensation and prices.  As somebody pointed out, the fact that even at a 4½ percent unemployment rate we really have seen very little, if any, pickup in labor costs suggests that my concern about that occurring at a 5 and a 5¼ percent unemployment rate would be very, very low.  If the staff is right—and, of course I just heard the Romers lecture me about how the staff was right and the Committee wasn’t—[laughter] then a 50 basis point decline would just about put interest rates at neutral.  It wouldn’t be accommodative, and therefore, I don’t think would be particularly inflationary. I agree with everyone else.  If I thought that a decline in rates would increase the most likely forecast for inflation—put it on an upward track—that would be unacceptable.  Or if I thought a decrease in rates would increase inflation expectations, which would then give legs to an increase in inflation, that would not be acceptable either.  But I think a decrease in rates at this time under these circumstances doesn’t really have that risk.  It does shift the balance of risks a bit.  If you take a little of the downside risk out of growth, you are presumably taking some of the downside risk out of inflation, maybe shifting that risk on inflation at the same time.  But I think a substantial decrease in interest rates at this time would not shift those risks on inflation so that they would deviate from the general path over the next couple of years that most of us saw in our projections in October.  So I’m not as concerned as President Lacker about that. In sum, I agree that we need to reduce rates substantially just to get close to buying insurance.  I would do it sooner rather than later.  I would have been prepared to support an intermeeting move today.  I think the data are weak enough; we are far enough behind the curve. To me, looking at the equity market declines, what we have seen since the middle of December is a bit of a loss in confidence in the financial markets that we will do enough soon enough to keep the economy on an even keel.  So I think there has been a palpable deterioration in confidence in the Federal Reserve out in the financial markets.  I am concerned that we are going to get three weeks of bad news and that the erosion of confidence will just gather steam.  But I see the issues and the negatives also.  An orderly FOMC process is to be protected.  We are at risk of scaring the markets or looking as though we are lurching.  I think we are at risk, if we move, of creating market dynamics such that they would constantly be in volatility and on alert as to when the next intermeeting move is.  So there are a bunch of negatives here; and I guess on balance the case for moving—especially if it’s not supported generally by the Committee because I think it has to be supported generally by the Committee—is not overwhelming. Obviously, I am prepared to wait and make a substantial move at the meeting, but I agree that you should signal something in your speech tomorrow that we are likely to move against the emerging economic weakness.  I don’t think, President Fisher, that a speech that the Chairman makes after consulting with the whole FOMC is comparable to the speeches we make as individuals.  He doesn’t have the risk of misleading the market when he has heard from all of us at the same time.  This is a very different situation from the situation that many of us were in during the previous intermeeting period.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
59,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.,  Thank you.  Governor Warsh.
60,MR. WARSH.,"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Just a few notes.  First, on financial markets and financial market functioning, I think as Bill Dudley suggested that they are much improved from our last meeting.  I take that as a very, very good sign, and I think that the improvement in financial market functioning will be useful to us to help calibrate the effects of changes in monetary policy.  We spent some time even today talking about where we are on some range between neutral and accommodative and where we want to go.  When the markets aren’t working, then any policy that we could conceive of would in effect be restrictive, if the markets weren’t willing to take our action and do something with it to provide credit.  So I think we were right to focus on getting the markets back to work, which is a process that isn’t complete, but I think the trends are our friend there.  Second, concerning financial intermediaries, I would underscore the point that the Chairman made at the outset.  The problems among large financial institutions are very serious, and unlike financial market functioning, which has improved, I think the state of these institutions has not improved since we met last.  While it is true that they have been raising capital, both in the form of equity and convertibles, the process of writedowns and capital-raising is far, far from being complete.  I think we continue to have some headline risk, both in the United States and among non-U.S. institutions, between now and our meeting at the end of the month as well as throughout the first quarter. The good news is that the real economy data have superseded those data with respect to financial institutions.  The bad news is that these top twenty or so institutions are still largely ill- equipped to facilitate credit or to be shock absorbers here to any great degree.  If you think about that in terms of other shock absorbers that might be available, including fiscal policy, I think there is reason for the seventeen of us on this conference call to feel relatively lonely in thinking about policies that can be brought to bear, both from the private sector and the public sector. With respect to the real economy, even if one isn’t as pessimistic in terms of probabilities of a mild recession or as pessimistic on the chance of a really, really ugly scenario much more dire than that, I still think that risk management suggests going in the direction that the Chairman emphasized for reasons that have already been discussed by many others on this call. As I mentioned, I think there is more burden on monetary policy as I think about fiscal policy and some of these other measures.  That gives me a view that perhaps we should be erring on the side of reaching for a little more by way of rate cuts than we would in a parallel universe where we had financial institutions and fiscal policy that were likely to be quite useful.  I’m somewhat less certain that either of them will be able to stand here in the fray.  With respect to tactics, I think the right course of action is, as Governor Kohn just referenced, for the Chairman to provide some direction to the markets in his speech.  That direction will not be perfect.  They will not understand exactly our posture, but I think they do need to hear from him a sense of where we are collectively, and tomorrow provides a really good opportunity to do that.  It would be good for them not to be surprised to any great degree when we meet in a few weeks, and I think the Chairman will rightly focus them on the real economic data.  So as the data change, their own expectations of policy could change as well.  Governor Kohn talked about the possible erosion in confidence in our ability to put policy in place, and I think that by meeting today and hearing one another’s views, having the Chairman go tomorrow, and then meeting to finalize our judgments on policy action, given all our constraints, is the best course of conduct.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
61,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.,  Thank you.  Governor Kroszner.
62,MR. KROSZNER.,"  Thank you very much.  I, too, as everyone around the table has said, think that there is significant heightening of the downside risks over the last few weeks.  As I mentioned at the last FOMC meeting, in talking with a contact at a large credit card company, I saw a very sharp deterioration in consumer behavior.  I subsequently spoke with another credit card company that focuses more on the higher-end consumers and found exactly the same issues there of slowing payments—even taking into account the seasonals—more delinquencies, et cetera.  So it wasn’t just a middle market phenomenon; it was also happening on the higher end. The quick change between October and December–January, unfortunately, seems to be consistent—or is potentially consistent—with the regime-shift model that we have been talking about.  Also, the sharp rise in the unemployment rate could be consistent with that.  I just returned from Europe, where concern is growing and there are some especially sharp changes. Spain is seeing some very sharp changes in their housing sector as well as in consumption, and consumption is going down in the United Kingdom.  From discussions there, I also had the feeling that they are going to be relatively slow to react to the challenges.  So I think we will be getting less support than we have been getting from exports.  Also, given that a lot of rate resets are coming, we know that there are going to be more delinquencies and foreclosures.  That is kind of baked into the cake.  So we know that there are going to be more challenges in the financial system, regardless of everything else, over the next nine months.  It does make a lot of sense to think about taking out some insurance against those kinds of risks. I very much agree with the Chairman’s characterization of the challenges that we will have in the banking and financial system because I think it is not a traditional credit crunch, when there is a sharp contraction, because so much has been brought onto financial institutions’ balance sheets.  Not only has a lot been brought on but also there is a really dramatically reduced ability to get things off the balance sheets.  Basically, over the last five years or so, the reason that financial institutions could provide so much intermediation and so much support is that things didn’t stay on the balance sheets.  Now, because there is an impaired ability to get things off the balance sheets, it requires much more capital to support the same amount of funding that had occurred in the past.  Just to try to keep funding at the same old levels is going to require dramatically more capital.  They will get more capital, but they are not going to get dramatically more, so that will mean that it will be more and more difficult for them to support funding of operations going forward.  So it is very important to think about taking out insurance now. With respect to inflation, as a number of people have mentioned, there are some disturbing readings recently.  But something that is heartening, and for me is really the most important thing, is that I don’t see much evidence so far of a significant change in expectations, because that is really where the long-term costs of our policy moves come in.  If there is a temporary slight movement up in inflation, if inflation expectations don’t become unanchored, then the cost is relatively low, particularly given the very large downside cost of a regime-shift to a recessionary scenario.  Although I am certainly supportive of a fairly bold move at this point, I do think it would be better to wait a few weeks.  I think we achieve some of that by clarifying where we stand through our public discussions.  But as a number of people have said, I really think we have done a very good job, despite a lot of pressure with respect to our reaction functions, in how we react to data, forecasts, and such.  I think we would lose some of that if we were to move today.  That doesn’t mean that we should never move, but I do think it would be a bit of a loss because people could misinterpret what we’ve been doing and, exactly as Governor Kohn said, set up a bad dynamic.  After our FOMC meeting at the end of this month, however, we actually have an enormous amount of data that come out because GDP comes out just as we’re finishing up our meeting.  Then the details come out after that.  We get another GDP report.  We’re going to get two employment reports.  So I certainly, in some sense, want to keep my powder dry with the possibility of an intermeeting move in the future, but I think that’s a time when we’re going to be getting a lot more data about which we may want to say it’s the time to move.  It would be better from our broader communications policy standpoint to say that there have been enough data showing that we really do need to make a move.  Thanks."
63,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.,  Thank you.  Governor Mishkin.
64,MR. MISHKIN.,"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I agree with the Chairman’s general assessment of the risks to growth, and I think that currently we are well behind the curve and that we need to act much more aggressively in terms of monetary policy.  However, I want to say that, even though I take the view that we need to be much more aggressive, I do not think that today is the day to do it.  There are really three reasons that I am not in favor of doing a move today.  The first is that it is very important to keep moving in the direction that I have hoped we are moving in, which is to be much more systematic in terms of thinking about monetary policy and actually communicating that to the markets and the public.  Moving today would have the potential to indicate that we are being much more discretionary than I think would be appropriate, and that could be very problematic.  I also would be concerned that it might give an impression that we would be overreacting to one piece of information—the employment report— and I think that would also be dangerous.  There is serious potential for this to be viewed by the markets as our panicking, and that would, again, be very harmful in the current environment. In terms of where I think we should be heading with monetary policy, I definitely think that given the information we have today, though things clearly may change in the next couple of weeks, we would need to move at least 50 basis points at the next meeting.  Actually, I don’t want to rule out the possibility of doing even more at the next meeting or talking about having a contingent move, for which we’d prepare the markets, so that it would be more systematic in terms of a possible intermeeting move afterwards because there is important information— another employment report, retail sales, and so forth—that will come out shortly after the next FOMC meeting. As I talked about at the last meeting—and I will go into this in more detail in a speech on Friday—I think it is very important to be ahead of the curve and react aggressively to financial market disruptions.  There is an issue of very strong nonlinearity that makes the normal response, which we think about in terms of doing optimal policy—the standard linear quadratic framework we often work in—not the correct one.  In a situation such as the one we are dealing with now, with a lot of potential for nonlinearity, it is extremely important to get ahead of the curve.  This argues for quite aggressive action at this point—as I said, not particularly today but in the near future. One concern that people have raised is the potential upside risks to inflation.  I am less worried about that than some other members of the FOMC for the following reasons.  Very importantly, inflation expectations seem very solidly grounded.  We have had no indication of any deterioration in terms of inflation expectations, despite our previous easing moves and the very high increases in energy prices.  Second, when I think about what drives inflation and what are the dynamics of the inflation process, what is important are expectations not only with respect to inflation but also with respect to the future path of output gaps.  In particular, I do not see at this juncture that people are worried that we are going to allow the economy to get overheated.  In fact, it is the opposite right now.  We are more worried about the downside risks, where there will be increased economic slack in the economy, and of course, that is consistent with the forecast coming from the Board staff.  So when I think about the inflation process, I think in terms of underlying inflation, which is inflation not over the next year but over the longer run, which is appropriate for monetary policy and when we can have an effect.  I do not see that the upside risk is huge there; in fact, this is very important in terms of allowing us to be aggressive in this situation of financial disruption. One issue that I think is very important, which other participants here have raised, is that there is a fear that we might overshoot if we ease aggressively.  In fact, two things could indicate that we may have gone too far.  One is that we frequently see financial disruptions dissipate very quickly.  That is what I hope happens, so it is not something that I would be depressed about.  I would be very pleased about it because, if things start going the right way, just as you can get an adverse or a negative feedback loop when these financial disruptions occur, you can actually get a virtuous feedback loop, and that can happen fairly quickly.  If that occurs, we should be very ready to take away some of the insurance that we have provided by aggressive easing.  The second is, of course, inflation expectations.  If aggressive easing led to the unhinging of inflation expectations, that would be a terrible thing.  The most important thing that I think we do is to ground inflation expectations; it is a key part of our success and of central banks throughout the world in recent years.  So I think we have to monitor very carefully what is happening to inflation expectations.  If our easing looks as though it’s causing a problem in terms of inflation expectations, then we have to act accordingly. I would argue that the way we have to think about policy is that we need to think about it being less inertial but maybe more systematic.  When we talk about risk management, I think in the past there was some element of thinking that risk management was just discretion.  We have to think about risk management in terms of being more systematic and to think about how we might react to changes in conditions so that we would not be inertial.  By so doing and indicating to the market that we were thinking that way, we could alleviate some of these fears. So the bottom line is that I think that we have to be ahead of the curve.  I am actually very sympathetic to President Evans’s view that we are going to have to move more than 50 basis points, certainly, over a longer period than just the next meeting.  I also think that we have to think about that hard and about doing this in a systematic way and prepare the markets to understand why we are reacting the way we are, so that we are not seen as being discretionary but as operating very much consistently with our dual mandate.  Thank you."
65,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.,  Thank you.  Vice Chairman.
66,VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.,"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me just say briefly that I completely support the basic framework that you laid out at the beginning, and I think you gave an excellent description of the risks that are ahead for us, the challenges we face, and the basic strategy we have to adopt.  The dominant imperative for monetary policy now is to get rates down to the point at which we are providing a substantial degree of insurance against the risk of a very adverse growth outcome and a more damaging financial crisis.  This is going to require substantial further policy action, and we are better off getting there sooner.  I think there is more risk to us now in gradualism than in force.  Of course, inflation has accelerated, but I think it is very important that inflation expectations have moved down since December, despite the move in headline and core and despite a very substantial downward move in the expected path of the fed funds rate.  Other than that, I would just reinforce the basic framework you presented.  I would take a fair amount of comfort from the fact that I hear a lot of agreement around the room both on your diagnosis of what is happening and in a general recognition of the extent of deterioration in the outlook and the extent of the increase in terms of the risks to the outlook. That gives us a better basis for a pretty solid consensus in the Committee on the outlook ahead. Thanks."
67,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.,"  Thank you.  Well, in this less than two hours, we have covered intermeeting moves, policy strategy, assessment of the economy, and inflation dynamics.  I think it has been pretty productive.  Seriously, I very much appreciate it.  I promise to try not to do this too often, but getting this intermeeting update has been very useful for me.  I very much appreciate it.  I think we are a little better prepared for the next meeting when it comes, although obviously, as President Poole pointed out, we will be seeing a lot of data and certainly there is no pre-commitment to any specific action.  But I do think there is at least a reasonable amount of support for the idea that some insurance is worthwhile, and we should keep that in mind as we go forward.  Are there any other comments?  President Hoenig."
68,MR. HOENIG.,"  Mr. Chairman, just a question.  Will you let the world know we had this meeting?  I ask only because I have a directors’ program tonight and a directors’ meeting tomorrow morning, and I don’t know what the circumstances are about acknowledging this meeting or anything else.  So I would appreciate some information."
69,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.,"  It will be described, I assume, in the minutes, which will be three weeks after the next meeting, so it will be six weeks before this is reported.  It will be reported, I assume, as a consultation and discussion of the economy.  I would advise you not to discuss this with your directors.  If it gets into the market, it could cause confusion and uncertainty.  So if possible, I would not discuss it."
70,MR. HOENIG.,  I appreciate knowing that.  Thank you.
71,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.,"  Thank you.  President Lacker, do you have a point or a comment?"
72,MR. LACKER.,"  Yes.  At the outset, in your discussion you said you were doing this in part to seek our views before you made a speech and testified and wanted our views before you engaged in overt signaling to the market.  Someone else mentioned this, but I wanted to support this as a practice.  I don’t expect you to consult us before every public utterance you make but I would just compliment you on this innovation in Federal Open Market Committee practice.  So thank you very much."
73,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.,"  Thank you.  Any other comments?  If not, have a good dinner.  Thank you very much, and we will see you in Washington at the end of January, if not sooner.  Thank you. END OF MEETING"
